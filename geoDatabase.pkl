VThis cache puts the "I" back in team. It can be reached by foot from the bottom or by some form of floatation device from above.  To reach it by foot, start from the park at the mouth of logan canyon and head up the trail on the north side of the highway until you find water and follow your gps from there.  On a hot summer day try this variation.  Drive up logan canyon a few miles until you see a dirt "pull off" on the north side of the road that has a small culvert emerging from under it.  Start there and float until your gps tells you you have passed it.  It is a small hike from there.  I believe you can hike from the pull off as well but I have never done it.  This water is very cold so if you plan to float or walk in the water, come prepared. Don't be afraid to move a few rocks as it is not in plain sight.  The original items include log book, several millenium edition tyconderoga pencils, a sound track from the award winning 1986 inspirational series Free to Choose, polished pink rock, some foreign coins, and an army man for good measure.

VAs stated above this cache is a difficult one in late fall,winter and spring.  If you are looking for a challenge in the winter grab some cramp-ons and give it a shot, the area in which it is placed is not far from the road.  The elevation change from the road to the cache is about 250-200 ft, the snow will more than likely be deep and slippery in this area.  The cache is located on the edge of a cliff-like drop off.  A stone pillar has been placed to make finding it easier in the snow cover.  Give it a shot, but be carefull!!!\u000a\u000a    Summer cachers:  This cache is in a steep area, but much much easier when the ground is not slippery....\u000a\u000aPark at the enterence to the Stokes Outdoor center trail.\u000a\u000a

This should eliminate the need to cross under the bridge as some have previously done making this more difficult then it was meant to be.\u000a\u000a    This cache is a rubbermaid container and is located within a few meters of a well worn path, so no need to stray from the designated trails and lessens the impact enviromentally on the area. Original contents:Reindeer pin, Wooden Soldier, Old collectors milk lid, Scooby Doo II pin, Crayola coloring book, Candy cane straw, Disney post cards, Canada Hacky Sac, Teddy Bear, Canada Flag Patch, Kids rain Pancho, Ty Bumble Bee, Elephant Key Chain and Spiderman mini comic book.\u000aPlaced "Oreo has the Travel Bug" TB

VA Ladies' Auxiliary to the Great War Veterans Association was started in 1919 to aid the club and to choose a memorial to war veterans. It took them years of bazaars and other various fund-raising efforts to be able to pay for it, including the clock which they ordered from England and cost $1,063. The city council stepped up and contibuted a large amount of the remaining fees, with the total cost of the construction being $5000. The Memorial was duly finished and the unveiling took place on May 24, 1925

In fact, you have to watch your feet when walking on the trail closest to the road in from the Alleyne camp area to the Kentucky camp area as you might step on one of the tiny creatures.

The trail to the falls itself is quite\u000aeasy (I'd only rate it a 2), however the final descent down to the\u000acache can be quite difficult depending on your route. The easiest\u000away to approach this cache is from the falls viewpoint to the west\u000aof the cache. Expect large boulders and a modestly steep slope.\u000aProper footwear should be worn.

VChristina Lake is located along the Crowsnest Highway in the south-central area of British Columbia known as Boundary Country, which separates the Okanagan region from the West Kootenays. It is located 23 kilometers east of Grand Forks, just 1 km north of the United States border. The lake is renowned as the "warmest tree-lined lake in Canada".\u000a\u000aChristina Lake is home to approximately 1456 permanent residents in the winter and thousands more in the summer months. The lake is long and more then 180 meters deep in some sections. The warm water temperatures can be attributed to the fact that a sizeable fault runs through the middle of the lake which supplies constant geothermal heat, which can push the tempature up to the 23°C range in the summer.\u000a\u000a\u000ato log this cache please email the cache owner the answers to the following questions do not post in your log.\u000a\u000a1) Please Estimate the width of the lake from this viewpoint\u000a\u000aPlease post a picture of you or your GPS with the lake in the background from the viewpoint..

VThis should be a quick cache find away from the eyes of stopping muggles.  The passing muggles shouldn't be a problem.  \u000a\u000aThere are many picnic tables here and some have views of the West Kettle River. There is also river access for canoists.  Across the river is the West Kettle Valley Trans Canada Trail (TCT) which is a popular cycling trail.  The road to Conkle Lake Provincial Campground is not far from here as well.  (If you turn off on this road and cross the bridge you should be able to access the West Kettle Valley TCT off the Blythe Rhone Road. Of interest:  Paul Lautard's War Memorial in Rhone has become a rest stop for cyclists. Paul has built a beautiful shelter with hammock inside, an out house and picnic table on the site and a bicycle railing for leaning heavily ladened pannier bicycles against.)

VThis is a two-stage cache.  You access the general area via the Rosehill Road.  If you wish, you can park at N 50 39.658, W 120 18.015, but please don't block the gate.  It must be left accessible to natural gas crews.  There are also places to park beside the road about 75 m down the road from the gate.\u000a\u000aShould you prefer, you can also access the area from the Juniper Ridge side.  Thanks to the ongoing housing development, the walking distances are now about the same.\u000a\u000aThe cache itself is a 1 litre lock n' lock.  When hidden it contained:\u000a\u000aplastic pig\u000acalculator w/ pen in folding case\u000akeychain light\u000aCanada key ring\u000asmall, 3-cornered file\u000azodiac key chain\u000alogbook and pen\u000a\u000aThe first stage has a simple clue that needs decoding.  It provides the co-ordinates to the cache itself.  There is a decent view of the city along the way.  You may wish to take a camera.\u000a\u000aNOTE:  I had some problem getting a stable, accurate lock on the co-ordinates for the first stage.  Even after several attempts, they seemed to keep changing by about 10 m or so. For that reason I'm posting a somewhat more obvious clue to its location than I otherwise would.\u000a\u000aHappy hunting.

VAs this cache is located in a Provincial park, it is a theme cache .... stuff you need to go camping. The container is an ammo box. When placed, it contained a mosquito coil, flashlight, combination compass/thermometer/whistle, tick remover, 2 light sticks and a candle. The cache is located on a side trail about 100 m off of the Gus Johnson Trail, which is a circle hiking or mountain biking route around Lac le Jeune. The Gus Johnson Trail trail can be accessed from either the campground or the end of Lookout Road.

VWe discovered this wonderful vista on our way back from the Skmana Lake cache and I insisted we stop and place a cache.  Was also surprised to discover a creek and small waterfall about 10-15m away.  You'll hear it!  The cache is a peanut butter jar holding our brand new signature item (pen), horse magnet, shark keychain LED light, tape measure keychain, polished stone, two-for-one coupons, and other small items, along with the log book, two pencils, and the geocaching note.  The FTF prize is a scratch & win ticket.  PLEASE COVER CACHE AFTER REPLACING TO KEEP IT OUT OF SIGHT OF MUGGLES!  DON'T OVER DO IT THOUGH AS THAT SOMETIMES DRAWS MORE ATTENTION.  THANKS.\u000a\u000aOnce turning off the Trans Canada Highway into Chase, find the bridge that crosses the South Thompson River at N50 49.579  W119 41.893, and once across it turn immediately to the left.  Drive about 4.3 km to Loakin Bear Road and turn right on it.  Watch for the osprey nests around this area!  The cache is located about 1km further up the road at a switchback corner where you can park.\u000a\u000aAbout 3km further up the road, but turning left on the Niskonlith Lake Road, is the Niskonlith Lake Provincial Park which has 30 rustic campsites on the eastern shores of the lake. If you stay on Loakin Bear Road you'll come across Skmana Lakes Rec Site and a cache.  Continuing on you'll come to Roderick Haig Provincial Park between Shuswap Lake and Adams Lake.  There you'll find another 3 caches, two of them at the log fume trails. It makes for a great day outing!  You can go back to the Trans Canada highway through Squilax.

VCache is a plastic lock-n-lock container located near a viewpoint on a popular hiking/mountain biking trail in Kenna Cartwright Park in Kamloops, BC. When placed, it contained a mini address book, yo-yo, lucky Canada penny key chain, deck of cards, 2 mini hot wheels cars, Smokey the Bear shoulder patch, two TNRD pins and a Lisa Simpson doll. There are two access points to the park trails ... the Home Depot parking lot and the upper Hillside Ave. park entrance. From either entrance, its about a 1 hr hike to the cache.

VThis is Falkland\u2019s 2nd cache, a "CANADA" themed cache in a regular container within a container, located just off of Falkland Road, less than 1 km from Highway 97. Falkland is a rural community of about 600 residents, situated along Highway 97, between Vernon and Kamloops, 26 miles (42 km) from Vernon in the east and  45 miles (72 km) from Kamloops in the west.

VFalkland epitomizes the spirit of Canadian unity with the massive Canadian flag on the mountainside overlooking the town, made from sheets of painted plywood, and considered by many to be the largest Canadian flag in the nation.  The cache/parking location should give you a pretty good view of this hillside flag.  As you have to park on the side of the road, please exercise care by not parking too close to the blind corner and keeping well to the side.  \u000a\u000aPlease be careful removing/replacing the cache container from its hiding spot to prevent damage to the outer container.  Cache contents include log book, pencil, geocache info page, and numerous items with a Canadian theme:  pins, magnets, clip, keychains,  moose, balloon, pen, and ???  Using your imagination, it should be easy to stay with this theme!  (eg. items with flags/maple leafs or CANADA printed on them, Canadian stamps, Canadian money, Canadian animals etc.).  There\u2019s a FTF, 2TF & 3TF prize.  (3TF cacher please remove the plastic bag holding your prize)  The skeeters were out in droves when the cache was placed so recommend not wearing sandals and wearing long pants!\u000a\u000aAnnual events in Falkland include the Torch Light Parade every July 1, Daisy Days in August, the Falkland International Dog Sled Races, a two-day event on the second weekend in January, and the Falkland Stampede on the May long weekend, which offers 3 days of rodeo action, a parade and dances. \u000a\u000aWith so many small lakes in the area, there is no shortage of recreation sites for fishing, camping and picnicking. Established recreation sites surrounding Falkland include those at Joyce Lake, Pillar Lake, Chase Creek, Charcoal Creek, Bolean Lake, Spa Lake, Arthur Lake, Spanish Lake, Square Lake, and Pinaus Lake. \u000a\u000aAnd of course no trip to Falkland is complete without stopping at Pillar Lake. Geocachers, hikers, rockhounds, photographers and nature lovers will enjoy The Pillar, a 90-foot unique geological conglomerate of dirt and rock that can be reached via a short hike. A giant bony finger, the Falkland hoodoo, points skyward, balancing a precariously perched eight-tonne boulder on its tip.  Check out GCVHZ8 Hearthbreak Hoodoo, 11 km north on the Chase-Falkland Road.\u000a\u000aLittle story that I thought you'd like:  Our granddaughter, Rugrat #3 who is 3 yrs. old, loves to sing "Oh Canada" and is always singing it, while she plays or even sitting in the loo.  You'd laugh if you heard her version.  "Oh Canada . . . we pay for love!"

VThere are a couple of ways to get to this cache. When I placed the cache I started from the Lac Le Jeune side up the road past the campground. From the Fred Lake/Ross Moore lake road at waypoint 50 29.387 120 27.950 (trail location marker 32) I mountain biked up the "rustler" trail toward trail location marker 29. At waypoint 50 29.678 122 27.886 (before you reach marker 29) there is a side trail leading around the ridge. Follow this trail about 150 meters\u000ato 50 29.613 120 27.799 where you will find a trail that starts up the hill. Look for yellow flagging tape! The trail starts a little overgrown but becomes a well defined animal trail to the top of the hill. The trail is steep at\u000athis point. At 50 29.682 120 27.715 look for a trail on the right - and yellow or pink flagging tape. You should come out at the top at 50 29.642 120 27.661\u000aI suggest you mark waypoints along the way.\u000a\u000aYou can also come from the old dump/burn site - a 4x4 trail starts at 50 29.372 120 27.564.  It starts easy but gets narrow, rocky and steep.  This trail meets the X-Country ski trail.\u000a\u000aFor a longer (~4.5 km)\u000abut more defined and better trails start at the Stake Lake cross\u000acountry ski club and follow the trails to the lookout hut. See this\u000asite:\u000ahttp://www.overlanderskiclub.com/SiteCM/i/upload/7EDD3129BDBAF2D4636B6414DCD2569B5F9B138D.jpg\u000a\u000aThe cache is an ammo can with a few trade items. The real reward is\u000athe view.  If you find an\u000aalternate route to the lookout hut please email me the details.\u000aEnjoy the workout!

Just take a gift!\u000a\u000aREMEMBER: For safety's sake if you are heading north out of Vernon than you should turn left onto Stickle Road as per the coords at the top of the page and park, then go to the final cache.  If you are heading south into Vernon, then you can go into the info centre parking & go directly to the final cache.  \u000a\u000aFrom our rich cultural history, snow-capped mountains and sun-kissed beaches, to our exciting community events, Vernon has a lot to offer! \u000a\u000aMake Vernon your geo-caching destination!  We have a good variety of caches, including letterbox and puzzle caches, with a good range of difficulty and terrain that will keep you busy geo-caching for a day or two, and include no hikes, short hikes and long hikes.  Many of our caches have a view of one or more of the three lakes that fan out from our great city, or are by one of our creeks.  There are even caches to view our infamous murals throughout our downtown area.\u000a\u000aFor added fun, combine your geocaching adventure with one of our major events: Winter Carnival, Sunshine Festival, Apple Fest, Creative Chaos, Potters Sale, Annual Funtastic Ball Tournament & Summer Festival, Cowboy Festival, or the Wine Festival.

I also put in the Travel Bug that wants to get more of these types of caches going.  It will be necessary to use stealth due to muggles very often.  That will be the cacher's biggest problem.

VI have wanted to do a night cache near Kamloops since doing Vstarman's "Midnight Madness" in Penticton.  Now I have finaly got to it.  I hope you enjoy it.\u000aThe posted coordinates will get you to a parking place.  Shine your flashlight around until you locate a silver reflector on a tree.  From this first reflector, you should be able to locate the next reflector and so on until you find the cache.  \u000aNOTE:  There are several false trails with false caches at the end of them.  The false caches contain a note to chastise you and get you back on the correct track.  There are RED reflectors at the cache location.  The cache is located within 1 meter of the red reflectors.\u000aWhen the cache was placed, it had the ususal log book, pencil, sharpener, and a bunch of neat trade items.

VIt was brought to our attention that a Geo-Post Office was need in\u000athe West Kootenays so we were happy to help with the "Geo Pony\u000aExpress" \u000a<p>Here is how it works: Caches are placed to hold postcards. Each\u000apostcard will have a short message and a forwarding address on it.\u000aThe address will contain the person's name that you are trying to\u000asend the postcard to, their home city, and a destination cache. The\u000aidea is to move postcards between Geo-Post Offices until they reach\u000atheir destination. When you move a postcard or message from one\u000aplace to another, let the person who it's being sent to know where\u000ayou moved it to, because they might be near enough to go and pick\u000ait up. If you move a postcard from one Geo-Post Office to another,\u000aplease move it closer to the city or cache!</p>\u000a<p>You can send any message you want to anyone you want! How do you\u000aget started? Easy! Just write up your postcard and drop it in the\u000aGeo-Post Office! If there are any postcards in the cache when you\u000aarrive, feel free to forward them on if you can. If not, don't\u000aworry, just leave them for the next cacher. The cache is a small\u000alock n' lock. There is no swag in the cache, it is for postcards\u000aand trackables only. Please don't feel that you have to run out and\u000aspend your hard-earned cash on a postcard at the store. You can\u000aprint and laminate a huge variety of postcards off the\u000ainternet.</p>\u000a<p>Located at the Park N' Ride at the junction of Highway 3A and\u000aHighway 6. You will see a trail leading from the parking\u000aarea....just follow your GPS.</p>\u000a<font color="blue">For a list of other Geo Post Offices: <a rel=\u000a"nofollow" href=\u000a"http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=2d076c25-a072-4d39-a7f2-0e9e11f3b81a">\u000aVisit Link</a></font>

VThis medium cache, hidden in a black tobacco container, is about\u000a3-4m off a path at a rest stop at Chase. After finding the cache,\u000abe sure to continue on the path about 40m to see the waterfall. \u000a<p>The cache is now rehid in a new location as of June 26, 2009,\u000abut I'm not sure if your GPS will now be able to help you find it\u000aas the satellite coverage is very erratic in this area because of\u000athe nearby cliff. The previous cache hide needed explicit\u000ainstructions in order to find it as the coordinates were so bouncy\u000aand one would get "no satellite coverage" constantly. This time\u000aaround at this new location, I was able to get readings without\u000alosing satellite coverage, although the coords were very bouncy. So\u000ainstead of giving you explicit instructions, I'm going to only give\u000ayou mini instructions and a good hint if you need it.</p>\u000a<p>As I had to make my own hidey-hole for the cache, you might see\u000athe cache hide from the path, but <b>please DON'T TOUCH what I put\u000athere to hide it from muggles passing by! You need to check out the\u000aback!</b></p>\u000a<p>Remember that the cache is a black-taped tobacco can, and <b>not\u000aa large blue rubbermaid container</b>. Not sure why, but there have\u000abeen two other caches hidden nearby which have confused cachers\u000atrying to find this one-and-only published cache. I've checked the\u000aletterboxing site and there is no cache published there, so it\u000aremains a mystery. <!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a</p>\u000a<table width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#0099FF" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/bcga_logo_icon.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VThis medium sized cache, just off a trail starting in the Chase\u000aRotary Club Centennial Children\u2019s Playground Park off Pine Street,\u000ais placed in one of the 12 hiding spots that were used at the\u000aLockwood family reunion in August 2006. The cache contains the\u000ausual geocache info sheet, loot, a pencil/eraser, pencil sharpener\u000aand a FTF pin. \u000a<p>The Lockwood family has many geocachers amongst them so one of\u000athe activities at the family reunion was a geocache event where\u000aabout six legit geocache teams took part leading the 3 family teams\u000aon a hunt for Groundhog\u2019s caches. It seemed a shame not to replace\u000aat least some of the caches, so this is the 1st one \u201crevived\u201d \u2013 the\u000aoriginal name being \u201cLockwood\u2019s Pirate Stash\u201d. Those cachers who\u000adid find it can log this on as a find if they wish, after the FTF\u000acacher finds it. Our family, the Lockwood Gang: Pappy90, Dyelo\u000a&amp; Blue Heron, Mikdeni, BCArcher, DoubleGemini, Farwood,\u000apoohbear, and Rugrats #1-5 (and of course us - Groundhog &amp;\u000aShadow). I know there will be at least 1 more cacher added to this\u000alist soon!</p>\u000aMuggles will be a slight problem, but mostly in the winter when the\u000aleaves will be off the bushes and the path will be in full view of\u000aa muggle\u2019s house, so stealth will be required.<br>\u000a<p>Rated as wheelchair accessible, although I can't remember if\u000athere's a step up onto the bridge. Path is hardpacked dirt, but not\u000apaved.</p>

VThe final cache contains a log book and pencil, as well as stickers for trading (I didn't want to make you go through all that trouble for a micro with nothing in it!)\u000a\u000aAnd now some history:\u000a\u000aTRU- Although it has been a place of post secondary education for over 30 years, in 2005 University College of the Cariboo and British Columbia Open University merged to become Thompson Rivers University. With over 500 faculty members, and 26 000 students, the school is well on its way to becoming an internationally recognized institution. The school offers almost 50 undergraduate degree options, as well as professional career diploma programs, and many certificates for trades and apprenticeships. The students cheer on the TRU Wolf pack, the athletic teams, and watch performances by TRUdat, the theatre group. The school motto is "Quansem Ilep" (To strive ahead). There are a number of clubs to join, including a fraternity and a sorority, and the TRUSU, the student union, who organizes numerous activities and campaigns on behalf of the student body.\u000a\u000aVexillology- the scholarly study of flags.\u000a\u000aSo, as the name suggests, this cache will take you to various flags on the TRU campus. There are several flags around the campus, which get changed internationally. Feel free to mention any flags you recognize in your log!\u000a\u000a\u000aI would recommend you try this cache on weekends or evenings, to avoid masses of students.\u000a\u000aI would suggested you walk to the various locations, instead of driving, so people can get a view of the campus and a view of the city, too.\u000a\u000aParking is available for a small fee ($3.00), but there are various spots around campus with short term meters as well, or you could park near-by and walk over. Also, the university has very good bus service.\u000a\u000aTo start with, your direction is "check the middle flag".\u000a\u000aThis is my first multi, and I think it will be direct enough, but if there is some confusion, let me know, and I'll try to clarify. Thanks, and Happy Caching!

VThis cache is acessed via a loop trail and can be reached either of 2 ways. There is a small pullout parking area near the trailhead at N 50 43.628, W 120 30.569 with about 180 m of elevation gain from the trailhead to the cache. Head east from the trailhead for a  2.3 km 45 min hike to the cache or go northwest for about a 2.0 km 40 minute hike. Either way, the loop trail makes for a great hike. Please don't take quads, 4 by 4's or motor bikes into this area as it's a Provincial Park with a very delicate desert ecosystem. Take lots of water with you in the summertime.

VThis cache has only small trade items - coins, jewelry and pins. \u000a\u000aThe Hudson's Bay Fur Trading Company had a graveyard near their post but the small village of Kamloops developing to the East of the Post needed one as well.  A local farmer John Peterson gave some land to the Government Agent John Ussher for that purpose.  Ussher was subsequently murdered in 1879 by the McLean Gang.  The Townsite Syndicate eventually bought Peterson's land and the cemetery was included in the sale.  The Syndicate began charging interment fees and Peterson himself had to pay $8.00 to bury his wife on land he had donated.  The cemetary became crowded, neglected and overgrown. This entire park was once the cemetery, with most of the grave sites unmarked.  The derelict cemetery was eventually tended and the surviving headstones were all moved to this one corner. You can visit them today and catch a brief glimpse of Kamloops history.

It is very busy during the school hours and I think it would be best to do it on a weekend, but, there are still mugglers so watch out. There is a small hill to walk up but, there are also stairs.

VThis cache is on the schools millennium trail on the far North side of the school. The trail was created in the year of 2000 by the school, and the wetlands in 2006 by a class and a visitor. The cache is about 20 meters away from the wetland and is just off the millennium trail. Since the trail is six years old it is starting to wear away and it is hard to see, but, it is going to be redone soon. \u000a\u000aIn the Fall of 2006 the wetland was built/constructed by some of the students at RLC School with a wildlife biologist (Tom R. Biebighauser). Tom came to Kamloops to teach about wetland construction and to build a few sample wetlands in Kamloops and area. Tom was sponsored to come from the States by a number of concerned local conservation groups.\u000a\u000aPlease hide the cache like you found it if not better because it is a very busy place with the school and the trail itself. The best place for parking is in the school parking lot. You also need to be stealthy. This is a log only cache and has no pencil or pen so bring your own.

VI have lived in the area for 17 years and Dyelo has lived in the area most of her life -- we won't say how long that is, and neither of us had ever visited these magnificent falls before placing this cache!\u000a\u000aThis is a spectacular 60 foot waterfall dropping along Beaver Creek.  This is a dramatic plunge through a steep canyon.  There is a spur trail that leads down to a viewpoint and on down to the base of the falls.  It would appear the "locals" have installed a rope in a slump area, whereby the kids pull themselves back up the slope.\u000a\u000aPlease exercise extreme caution near the edge, on the trail down (if you should be so bold) and the rope pull (if you should try)!\u000a\u000aThere is NO need to go near the edge to find the cache.\u000a\u000aThe Beautiful British Columbia Mini H2O Tour or BBCM H2O Tour is approximately 110 kilometres, taking a loop from Salmo, south to Nelway, west along the Pend-d\u2019Oreille River Valley (Part of the Dewdney Trail and planned part of the Trans Canada Trail) to Waneta, north towards Montrose and then NNE and finally east via Fruitvale back to Salmo.\u000a\u000aThere is an abundance of water in most of this gorgeous province.  Water is the lifeblood of man and beast.  We have tamed nature\u2019s food for:  power, irrigation for farming, drinking water, recreation in the form of swimming, boating, fishing, camping, panoramic viewing, and even gold panning.  There should be evidence of all these examples and perhaps a few more on this tour!\u000a\u000aThe tour can be done in any direction, with each of the 14 caches leading up to the final being stand alone caches, but keep in mind that the final cache \u2013 Nature\u2019s Gift is near Salmo; said to be home to the finest drinking water in the land!!!\u000a\u000aAt ten of the caches you will find a clue that is written on both the lid of the container and the first page of the log book.  Sound familiar?  Record this clue.  Four of the caches don\u2019t contain a clue, but which ones don\u2019t?  Well I guess you will have to do the circuit to find out!\u000a\u000aIt is best to park at N49 06.026, W117 33.594 and walk the easy 1.6 km along the old line to the cache.  There is a much shorter route, but I haven't determined if it is through private property as yet.\u000a\u000aYou are looking for a cammoed tobacco tin with original contents of: FTF, Stuffy worm, ball, pin, spirit rocks, Cure Kids Cancer bracelet and Koosh ball.\u000a\u000aEnjoy the view, but watch the kids!!!!  Continue with the tour!

VAbout 1.5 km beyond the end of the pavement on the Lac Du Bois Grasslands road, turn left onto the gravel road to the communciations tower site.  It is kind of rough in spots, but 2WD accessible.  Approximately 2 km up this road is a locked gate and a good spot just below it to park.  From here follow your GPS across the grasslands.  There are some trails, but these are only partially helpful.  The direct walking distance is less than 700 m.  The terrain slopes upward and becomes more steep as you appoach the cache.  \u000a\u000aThis is rattlesnake country so keep your eyes open.  Ground cactus is present too.   Between that and the rattlesnakes, I can't recommend this as a dog-friendly site.  And of course, there will also be ticks in season.\u000a\u000aThe earlier cautions (snake den and cliff) don't really apply anymore as of May 19th, 2008.  Entries from May 17th and 19th in the logs below, will explain why.  I checked a 25 m radius around the new site and found no sign of potential rattlesnake dens.  The view however is still pretty good.  Maybe better than before.  I'd recommend bringing your camera.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a small ammo case.  When placed it contained 4 novelty keychains, a small pair of scissors, a fingernail cutter, a deck of cards, a logbook with a mechanical pencil plus refill leads.

VIt is a 20 minute walk from were you would want to park your car. Once you have parked take a short walk down the roadway until you see the cut raod that heads up the mountain. It is an up hill walk but, not steep. It's an old road that is now used for hydro. When you are on the New Trail Bridge you will be able to see the road that cuts up along the side of the mountain.

VThis cache is just off a multi use hiking, biking and cross country ski trail.  The cache container is a 1 litre camoed lock n lock.  If you want to drive part way to the cache take the Ross Moore Road from the Lac Le Jeune side - you will pass our other cache in the area "Road to Ross Moore".  A short way up the road the multi use trail crosses.

VThe Paulson Bridge is located on a gorge along the "Blueberry-Paulson" section of Highway 3 (between Castlegar and Christina Lake BC).\u000a\u000aThis bridge uses an arch design. The basic design of the arch was perfected by the Romans. Arch bridges are very strong structures. Each end of an arch bridge is anchored\u000afirmly with the bridge curving up toward the middle (just the underside in this case).\u000a\u000aWe have named this bridge Deception as the height looks much further than it really is -- The length is about three times the height!!\u000a\u000aThere is parking and paved road at both stages of this cache. Please replace cache and hide as found. If trading, think small as cache is a locking plastic container measuring 1.5x3x6 inches.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to climb, unless one wants to get a better view below the bridge. In this case, use extreme caution! Original contents are: FTF prize, ball mark repair, frog, colorful eraser, superhost pin, bag clip, keychain and marbles. \u000a\u000aAt the above coordinates, you will find a sign with\u000ameasurements of the Paulson Bridge. Height=a, Length=b,\u000aElevation=c, Arch Span=d. Calculations: Use a & b to calculate the latitude of the final location. Use c & d to calculate the longitude of the final location.\u000a[(a+b)x(3/2)]-15=xxx    c-d-132=yyy\u000aNew coordinates = N 49 11.xxx and W 118 06.yyy \u000a\u000aIf you are into cycling abanded rail grades, a popular day ride in the Castlegar area is to exit Highway #3 at the detour road about two km east of this bridge. Turn right on the rail trail and ride the 2% grade back to Keenleyside Dam. For further information on this rail trail go to www.castlegar.com/columbia_western.htm\u000a

VWith the tree cover we weren\u2019t getting good accuracy so we\u2019re not sure how close the coordinates are.  Oh well, Santa can find everyone\u2019s Christmas tree to put presents under!  Right?  The christmas cache is hidden in a tin within a rectangular plastic container which is in a green cloth bag.  Regular trading items will be in the plastic container, which holds the christmas tin.  If you take from the Christmas tin, please replace with a Christmas theme item.  Please ensure that the cache is replaced as found.\u000a\u000aIn 1974 Margaret Pearse donated the land for Pearse Park for the recreation and enjoyment of the community of Westwold.  There are a few picnic tables near the highway in this mini-forest of mostly pines.  The park seems to be a little neglected, so the trails are not well maintained.  However, it\u2019s a nice place to stretch your legs and take your dog for a walk. Remember our motto "Cache In and Trash Out!"  \u000a\u000aI decided to do a Christmas theme cache here because this small farming community of Westwold, having only a few business establishments, has a large Christmas store open all year long!  You'll have to check it out if you have time as the indoor light displays are great!  There\u2019s also the General Store & Café, the Route 97 Diner & Bakery, and an antique emporium store -- and that's about it in Westwold, other than the old church and the school. You can't get lost here, but it's a great place to stop, shop and have a bite to eat! \u000a\u000aWhen I purchased the FTF & 2TF prizes in the Country Christmas Store not far from the cache location, I explained to the proprietor what I was doing, and he gave me a short written history of his community.  \u000a\u000aThis is my shortened version of it\u2019s history: Westwold, actually an extinct volcano, carried the name \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d from the early 1800\u2019s until 1928 when the name was changed.  A postmaster had neglected to register the name, and as \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d was used in Alberta after 1881, a new name was chosen.  The earliest known map naming Grand Prairie is dated 1832.  A cabin was built in 1819 by the North West Company and was used as they passed through the valley. The first land pre-empted was in 1864 by John Grieve, Roger Moore and Edward Grove, and \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d was then officially established.  Their land was transferred to Henry Ingram later that year when Henry also acquired land.  Ingram was part of a syndicate that put camels on the Gold Trail as pack animals.  For several reasons the camels did not work out and several were brought to Ingram\u2019s farm where the camels were sheared for mattress and pillow stuffing.  The community of Westwold was once a very busy and important stopping place that did have a hotel until 1942.  However, it\u2019s importance to outlying communities ceased to exist once the automobile became popular, and now few people stop there. Let's try to change that!

VOpposite this rest area is the charred evidence of the Cedar Hills\u000aforest fire which ignited in the late evening on Friday, August\u000a1,2003. It was discovered and reported by a fire warden. The fire\u000astarted directly across the highway from the rest stop, and in\u000aplaces, it spread onto the other side of the highway a little\u000afurther east, sparing a farm and the Whispering Pines Motel. The\u000aweather and fire intensity at the time were high to extreme. The\u000afire burned over 1,645 hectares of land and one residential home. A\u000afire investigation was completed and the cause was determined to be\u000aa discarded cigarette from a passing motorist. (Most of the above\u000ainfo I received from a Provincial Fire Information Officer). Thanks\u000aalso for those who fought this fire! There is a sign posted in the\u000aburnt section to remind travellers to prevent forest fires. \u000a<p>Although Smokey Bear is not a Canadian icon, many of us grew up\u000awith this fictional character giving us forest fire prevention\u000amessages on posters. Remember Smokey Bear with his forest ranger\u000ahat and shovel in hand?

The cache is a 30 cal. ammunition container, and should be easy to find out in the grasslands.  It originally held a variety of Ducks Unlimited stuff, cap, video, duck ID cards, even an alarm clock in case you want to get up early to watch a dawn flight.  It is also the starting point for the travel bug "Hoodie" the merganser.

VThis is my wife and I's first cache.  We had fun putting it together and tried to make it worth someones while to go find it.  Contents include: waterproof camera (leave a picture of yourself), FS Notebook, $10 Gift Certificate to Ric's Grill in Kamloops, cuccumber candal, alien key chain, dream dictionary, bible, UNO card game, squash ball, balloons, toothpicks, Salto Del Laja Key chain, mini tool, GEOCOIN, and ducky key chain.<p>Good grief maybe we should have spread all that stuff through two caches.  Anyway, it's worth the effort to find as the bluffs are spectacular and there is somewhat of a nice view from the top.  The trail to get up the bluffs is quite steep but dose not require ropes or other gear.  Only strong, stable hikers will want to attempt the climb.

Follow the path to the Original Cariboo Wagon Trail and then go with your GPS.\u000a\u000aFrom 1861-1863 the Royal Engineers from England supervised construction on this 400 mile road. The fur trading companies opened up the interior of the province but the Cariboo Gold Rush was the impetus for the establishment of communities such as 100 Mile House.\u000a\u000aThe amazing thing is that over 100 years later it still looks like you could drive a team and wagon over this trail.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a plastic container in a garbage bag.

VThe area is a natural preserve.  Stay on the trails, and trust your instincts.  The cache is very close to a trail, and although it is well hidden, its location should be easy to see.  Please keep it well covered with the sticks and debris.  This is a good place to practise "cache in and trash out", as it looks like a black bear has used parts of the preserve to stash the trash he takes from peoples garbage cans.  I had no trouble getting a full bag when I placed the cache.  It is a tupperware container with a blue lid.  It contained a deck of playing cards, a folding scissor set, some mosquito repellent, a Kamloops pin, an obsidian arrowhead (from Mexico), a carabiner, a bungee cord, a loonie, an agate from the Queen Charlotte Islands, a foreign coin and a roll of pennies.<br>Parking may pose a problem, but there are lots of streets around.

VIn the late 1800's the City of Toronto set about building a new City Hall.  This building was completed in 1899 and was said to be one of the most stunning buildings of its time.  (However, it was later replaced by another structure in 1965 and is now known as Old City Hall.)<br><br>\u000aThe story holds, that the architect of the City Hall wanted more recognition than just his name in small print on the building's cornerstone.  The city fathers refused!  Not to be denied, he had a message incorporated into stone and placed around the entire building.  (As well, his face was set into the entry arches outside the main doors.  All other faces were said to be caricatures, of local politicians, while his face was not a caricature.)<br><br>\u000aThe message starts on the west side of Old City Hall and runs around the four sides of the entire structure.  Each letter of the message is carved onto one of the many corbels just under the roof.  Once you find the first set, the pattern becomes obvious, and you can work your way around the building.<br><br>\u000aTo verify that you have found the proper virtual cache, please email me with the following information:<br><ul>\u000a    <li>What is the text of the message?<br>\u000a    <li>Break the message into the sets, as they are found on the building.</ul><br>\u000aI will email you back and if your answers were correct, you may log your visit to the virtual cache.  Please do not include details in your find that would spoil the fun for others (no encrypted hints either).<br><br>\u000a(Please Note:  Old City Hall is currently undergoing some major renovations and scaffolding may hide some of the text.  Include as much as you can find on the four sides.)\u000a

VEverybody is welcome to my cache, but I would love to keep the theme of my cache as girly as possible. It\u2019s a clear Tupperware container with a white lid. The contents of the container are: 2 very cute pink notebooks, 1 pink touch lamp, 1 set of pink and purple hairclips, 4 piece pink scented candles, 3 pink bath bombs, 1 pink face towel, 5 color band-aids, 1 set of pink pens, 1 pink bath glove, 1 pink flower mirror, 1 pair of pink flip-flops, 1 deck of mini cards and 1 FOXY D doll trademark. If you decide to take the ferry to the Island I would recommend you to take the Ward\u2019s Island Ferry, but either one will take you there. I hope you enjoy this cache as much as I enjoyed putting it together for you guys.

VWelcome to my cache, Ghostcache. It is located on the Toronto Islands and is easily accessible by foot, bike, rollerblades or any other mode of transportation (except by car, there are no vehicles allowed on the island except city service ones). Go to the Toronto Island Ferry docks and take any ferry you\u2019d like, there are three, Wards Island ferry dock is about 3 kilometers from Ghostcache, Centre Island ferry is about 1 ½ kilometers and Hanlan\u2019s point ferry is about 2 kilometers  (for ferry schedules and fees please call 416-392-8193). When you get off the ferry simply follow the paved road/trail, it stretches from one end of the island to the other and is a very nice walk. Just keep looking at your GPS and look up when you are close and you\u2019ll see the Gibralter Point Lighthouse (you can\u2019t miss it!), it\u2019s just off the trail. Follow the trail leading into the lighthouse and read the historical plaque on it, it dates back almost 200 years and is supposedly haunted by the restless spirit of one of the original keepers who was murdered over the moonshine he was running from the lighthouse. To this day people claim to see him roaming the grounds around the lighthouse in search of his missing limbs that were cut of by his murderers (for more info on the story, visit www.torontoghosts.org/lighth.htm). Ghostcache is aptly named for the location, and if you are brave, try it at night, that is when the ghost is said to be seen looking for his missing limbs! It is a clear plastic Tupperware container and contains the following,\u000a\u000a1 ceramic ghost\u000a1 ceramic \u201cthree ghosts on a ship\u201d\u000a1 ceramic \u201cSpooky\u201d  ghost travel bug\u000a1 farm animal set (pig, sheep, dog)\u000a1 toy horse with trees\u000a1 pen and pencil set\u000a1 ball\u000a1 set of batteries\u000a1 mini-mug	\u000a6 glow-in-the-dark plastic turtles\u000a\u000a\u000a  There is no particular theme for my cache, and everyone is welcome! Enjoy and happy haunting!!!!!\u000a

VThis is a Peanut Butter jar - carefully camoflagued with duct tape\u000a- hidden behind a tree just off the trail. The site is beside the\u000aLittle Cataraqui Creek near rushes that were just humming with\u000abirds this morning. I also saw a white-tailed deer and biked to\u000awithin just a few metres. This is a lovely location near the\u000aKingston end of the Rideau Trail - continuing on will eventually\u000alead to Ottawa. \u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border="0"\u000awidth="163" height="163"></a></center>\u000a<center><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ontgeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://www.ontgeocaching.com/images/ogalink.gif" border="0">\u000a</a></center>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>

VThe Niagara is a fairly young river, only 12,000 years old!, a\u000amicrosecond in geological time. The Niagara Escarpment, which was\u000acreated by erosion is much older. <br>\u000a After the last ice age when glaciers pressed down on the area, the\u000aslow process of erosion by ice and water has created this\u000aescarpment.<br>\u000a The mighty river plunges over a cliff of dolostone and shale.\u000aDolostone is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high\u000apercentage of the mineral dolomite. Most dolostone formed as a\u000amagnesium replacement of limestone or lime mud prior to\u000alithification. It is resistant to erosion and can either contain\u000abedded layers or be unbedded. Shale is a rock formed from fine\u000agrained muds and clays. It is characterized by thin laminae\u000abreaking with an irregular curving fracture, often splintery and\u000ausually parallel to the often-indistinguishable bedding plane. This\u000aproperty is called fissility.<br>\u000a Niagara Falls is the second largest falls on the globe next to\u000aVictoria Falls in southern Africa. One fifth of all the fresh water\u000ain the world lies in the four Upper Great Lakes-Michigan, Huron,\u000aSuperior and Erie. All the outflow empties into the Niagara river\u000aand eventually cascades over the falls.<br>\u000a<p>Please note that the posted co-ordinates will bring you to Table\u000aRock near the brink of the falls, but you will still have to look\u000aaround a bit for the required information. The plaque you are\u000alooking for is located at N43 04.861 W79 04.693</p>\u000a<p><b><font color="red"><font size="+1">To Log a find on this\u000abeautiful scenic earthcache you must email us with the dimensions\u000alisted on the historic plaque along with the most recent date of\u000arock fall. You must also take a picture of yourself/team with gps\u000ain hand ,standing with the Canadian Horseshoe Falls behind you (we\u000alove to see other cachers enjoying the view)and post it with your\u000afind log (please no spoiler).</font></font></b></p>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a<a rel="nofollow" href=\u000a     "http://www.ontgeocaching.com"><img src="http://www.ontgeocaching.com/images/ogalink.gif"\u000a     border="0"></a>

VThe cache is off a well-known highway that brings you to Butternut Creek.  You can park your vehicle at N44 15.642, W076 26.638 and begin your walk.  The trail follows the creek and is relatively easy, but parents will want to watch young children as it skirts a rock ledge.  The cache is not far off the trail and bushwhacking is very minimal.  This was created with a family-orientation in mind.

The contents include notepad and pens, Goofy figure, sports car, post-its, CITO containter, Canada keychain/bottle opener, Geocaching keychain/compass, Kellogg's step counter, race car game, necklace, various coupons, and Canadian Tire money (it might as well be gold!).

VAt the entrance to the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) is a display commemorating the 100th anniversary of Canadian Military Engineering in 2003.  The display is made up of a Sherman tank named \u201cAthene\u201d, crossing a double span Bailey bridge.  Historic military hardware situated at the entrance to a base, are referred to as being on \u201cSentry\u201d duty.  It is interesting that the bridge crosses an active creek.\u000a\u000aThere is a sign requesting that you do not climb on the monument. Don't worry, no climbing is required for this cache.

VTHE IDEA:\u000aThe level of intensity and degree of obsession among geocachers with the race for \u2018First To Find\u2019 status has caused me no end of amusement. Geocachers are hooked to their internet lifeline awaiting the next flash bulletin announcing the newest hide in their area. Thereupon, all else is immediately dropped and the mad dash is on. Well, this set of caches is my response to this phenomenon. Frustration will almost certainly result from the attempt to seek several far-flung caches simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE RACE:\u000aThere have appeared nine individual FTF Frustration micro caches, numbered 1 to 9, that are hidden near and far. They are to be treated as individual caches, not as a multicache. Those not interested in \u201cthe race\u201d may choose to find any of these caches at a more sedate pace (recommended) and enjoy the scenery along the way. In order to be eligible for the FTF prize though, you must find all nine and submit to all the requirements. Read the descriptions and difficulty ratings carefully. Not all caches are kid-friendly. Frustration is likely, hints are few. Be advised that tree climbing and a head for height may be necessary in some cases. \u000a\u000aTHE POINTS: \u000aThere will be a FTF prize. Qualification for the FTF prize requires the completion of certain conditions. You must find all nine FTF Frustration caches in any order. You must have the highest aggregate point score. Points will be awarded only for the first nine finders of each cache. Scoring will be done according to this chart:\u000aRanking	     Points\u000aFTF ..... 9\u000a2nd ..... 8\u000a3rd ..... 7\u000a4th ..... 6\u000a5th ..... 5\u000a6th ..... 4\u000a7th ..... 3\u000a8th ..... 2\u000a9th ..... 1\u000aYou must show proof of your find by uploading a clear photo showing your name in the log sheet, as well as the previous name listed. I will delete any spoilers, photo or written, until the winner is announced. I, and I alone, will decide the final winner, the prize and the time and method of delivering the prize. I will post the aggregate winner on each of the nine FTF Frustration web pages\u000a\u000aTHIS CACHE:\u000aThe cache is hidden near the Bayridge Drive and Front Road intersection. Nearby are two small lakeside parks at Smugglers Cove and at Horsey Bay, joined by a scenic walk along Old Front Road. A golf course and a small airport are in the vicinity. A short drive away is Lemoines Point Conservation Area. The car may be pulled off the road to park. If crossing the road, be careful of traffic coming around the corner.\u000a{My caches #2-9 \u2018FTF Frustration\u2019 series placed at 63 finds}\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on your FTF! **\u000a\u000a                \u000a** ** ** ** ** ** HONOUR ROLL ** ** ** ** ** **\u000a\u000a( All 9 of the FTF Frustration Series completed )\u000a\u000aMay 27 07............bluenoserstoo\u000aNov 14 07..............mTn_biKer65\u000aApr 24 08..................2 paddlers\u000aSep 15 08..................kayakers2\u000aDec 03 08...............KayakGeokid\u000aSep 09 09...............Trail Blaisers\u000aOct 20 09...............AaronHaynes\u000a.

VThe McLean House (Kingston Frontenac) Library and 6 hectares of\u000atrails overlooking the Great Catarqui River are two of Kingston's\u000alesser known treasures and you may have driven by them both every\u000aday and not even noticed! McLean House/Hawthorn Cottage is a 140\u000ayear-old farm house incorporated into a new library building. It\u000awas built in 1866 by John and Sarah Ruttan. The Ruttan family\u000acommissioned the building of the house while Mr. Ruttan was first\u000areeve of Pittsburgh Township. The building, erected by local\u000astonemasons is a typical, rather fine, mid-nineteenth century\u000aOntario one and one-half storey stone farm house.

V<p>My first cache, dedicated to kids and to those who are kids at\u000aheart. Hopefully we will never lose that sense of awe and adventure\u000athat is an integral part of the fun of discovery.</p>\u000a<p>I chose a location with kids in mind. Rotary Park at Lemoines\u000aPoint has a convenient parking lot, great play equipment, access to\u000athe lake, washrooms nearby, open grassy fields, picnic area, and\u000amany wooded trails. Some of the closer pathways are paved and\u000atherefore wheelchair accessible. The park is family friendly, dog\u000afriendly and free to enjoy. Bring your own food and drink. As I was\u000ascouting out a hiding place I came across a family of white-tail\u000adear at the cache site. We stared at each other for a long while.\u000aThey only scampered off when I reached for my camera.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is a medium sized plastic jar covered with duct tape.\u000aIt is filled exclusively with kid-related items. The cache is\u000ahidden in the woods on the other side of the road only a short walk\u000afrom the playground and up a short incline. It can be found under\u000asome big rocks. Of course adults should accompany young kids to the\u000acache site and maybe help them with their search. The cache should\u000anot be difficult to find. For those interested in a greater\u000achallenge or in racking up finds, there are other caches at\u000aLemoines Point Conservation Area.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on the FTF!</p>

VThis cache is to help bring more visitors to Woodbine Park, and to add on to the only other cache in the park, Woodbine Park Ponds. If you want to be near the Beach but still have some peace, you can easily spend a quiet hour strolling the paths or taking a seat by the fountain pond... or the marsh pond... or play with the kids in the splash pad (a MUST for all in the summer, I don't care how old you are!).\u000a\u000aIt's a Kraft peanut butter jar. There was a pen in the cache but it might have been used as a trade after all.\u000a\u000aPlease keep the pens in the cache, I think the first one got traded.\u000a\u000aGet to the park by TTC on Coxwell bus 22 or 22A. Ask the driver if you can get off at Eastern Av.(depending on the time of day). If you can't, then get off at Queen Street East and head south on Coxwell, cross over Eastern Avenue and voila you should see the welcoming flags.\u000a\u000aYou can park at the lots on Eastern Av. opposite the Alliance Atlantis Cinemas, or off Lakeshore at the Boardwalk Pub. Make sure of your spot... sometimes you have to pay... sometimes you don't!

VYou will be visiting Severn Creek Park, named for the creek that once flowed here and supported a number of early Yorkville businesses. It's now covered over... is it still flowing to the Don River? The north entrance to the park has a didactic panel which will tell you more! \u000a\u000aYou can enter from the north or south, allowing parking both ways, or from the Rosedale Subway station.\u000a\u000aThe north entrance is on Crescent Road, just off Yonge St. If you come from the subway, turn right you'll almost bump into the park sign!\u000a\u000aTHE NORTH ENTRANCE HAS STAIRS. THE SOUTH ENTRANCE IS LEVEL, FOR ANYONE NEEDING AN ACCESSIBLE ENTRY. \u000a\u000aThe south entrance is on Rosedale Valley Rd. north of the intersection with Park Rd. If you come via Aylmer Rd and Yonge St., you'll take the overpass and make a sharp left.\u000aBring some quarters for the parking meter just in case.\u000a\u000aMany cachers have scaled the hill from Rosedale Valley Road lately. Please don't, for your own safety and to protect the vegetation on the slope.\u000a\u000aThe cache is WITHIN THE PARK BOUNDARY and you shouldn't need to go more than 10ft off the grass.\u000a\u000aIt's a bigger Kraft peanut butter container.\u000a\u000aLots of summer growth and the lower lying location of the cache may affect your satellite capture. Getting a fix earlier on in your outing might help. It was placed in March when there was no cover, and coords appear to have been reliable.

VCammanron and I decided to place a cache near our work so we could keep an eye on it.  From the cache look northeast towards the building with all the satellite dishes on it and you might see one of us watching you.  \u000aNorway Park which was constructed in 1986 to serve the needs of the local residents.   Its name commemorates the World War II training base, used by the Norwegian Air Force, that once existed on the site. Existing park facilities include a baseball diamond and soccer pitch, playground and wading pool, as well as landscaped gardens and art installations.  \u000aPlease bring your own writing instrument as the cache is to small to hold one.  Stealth will be required depending on the time of day as muggles frequent the park.

VIn July 2003, on vacation on Cape Cod, a group of friends decided to try out a new sport, \u201cgeocaching\u201d.  With this first find, Bluelamb03 was born.  Bluelamb03 took to geocaching with enthusiasm.  Since that July day, Bluelamb03 has cached from his own backyard (not literally) to a stranger\u2019s backyard (literally) and across the ocean.  He has established caches in Canada and the UK.  In addition, he is a fervent promoter of the sport and a zealous member of Ottawa\u2019s \u201cSaturday Morning Caching Club\u201d aka the Geomob.\u000a\u000aOne of the trailheads is up by Hwy 15 at N44 15.225 W76 27.640.  If you follow your GPS to the closest spot, you will end up on the wrong side of a fence.

VThis is our very first cache.We hope you enjoy it.Here is an interesting story about the bay. \u000a\u000aWelcome to Deadman\u2019s Bay. The story goes like this. In the 1940\u2019s a man named Robert James was hired to build the gunnery known as Cathart Tower on Cedar Island. He met a beautiful girl named Elizabeth they fell in love and were to be married. One day as all the men were getting ready for a day off from work they noticed a storm was starting to brew. So 23 of the men jumped into the boat making for very tight quarters. The waters were raging and the boat overturned. Robert James died leaving Elizabeth alone and devastated. She refused to eat and died shortly after. To this day there are stories of a woman around the tower staring off into the bay. Maybe you too will get a chance to come across her. Good Luck and Have fun.\u000a\u000a\u000aBring your own writing stick. \u000aNo room for trade items.\u000aWalk towards the beach area there you will find the path.\u000a\u000aTo the FTF: A note with instructions will be placed in the cache for your FTF prize.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS!!!

Founded in 1792 by\u000aReverend John Stewart based upon a grant for secondary education in\u000athe colony of Upper Canada, it moved to its present location in\u000a1892. It is considered the oldest secondary school in Ontario.\u000aGirls were first admitted as students in January, 1877 and the\u000aschool has remained co-educational since.The oldest remaining wing\u000aof the school is the 1915 wing, which now houses science\u000alaboratories. The original wing was burned down in a fire and\u000areplaced. Several notable graduates include Peter Milliken, Helen\u000aCooper, David Usher, and the members of The Tragically Hip.</i>\u000a<br>\u000a<p>As a current student at this awesome school, I thought it\u000aappropriate to commemorate it and show some spirit through a\u000afavorite sport. The cache is a small black tin, containing lots of\u000arandom items, a log bog + pencil, and the geocaching sheet. Please\u000aleave something if you take something.

VI have modified the cache so that it may be completed by justing using information at each site.  If you chose this route use the alternate "On site" clue instead of the first clue at some of the sites.\u000aIf you want to solve the original cache use the first clue and come pre-armed with the following knowledge:\u000a1. Gun armament of past jet fighters used by the RCAF\u000a2. The main heavy guns used in British Fortifications circa 1812.\u000a3. Canadian tanks guns since WWII.\u000a  \u000a\u000aMost of this information can be quickly found on the net.  You may have to dig a little for the 1812 info, but that is not too hard in this town.\u000a\u000aThe sites are numbered in a rough tour, you can do them in any order, but bear in mind site 8 is close to the final cache location.\u000a\u000aTime for completion is about 2-3 hours.\u000a\u000aRMC is open to the public during the day. In the evenings it is still open but the commissionaires will record your license plate and ask your intentions (looking at the military hardware displays).  After midnight there is no admittance.  \u000a\u000aCache is a small round container.\u000a\u000aThe size of gun is always in the unit used for that gun during its use.  For example; inches, millimeters or pounds.\u000a\u000aCache is located at: 44 AB.CDE, 76 FG.HIJ\u000a\u000aCongrats to Swimmrguy on the FTF!

A\u000a\u201csavannah\u201d is broadly defined as a discontinuous canopy of tree\u000acover with a ground layer of grasses and wildflowers, and is\u000aconsidered to be a transition zone between prairie and the eastern\u000adeciduous forest. It is the combination of the two habitats that\u000agives oak savannah its own unique identity. Savannah is a globally\u000aendangered vegetation community. Human settlement has reduced it to\u000a0.01% of its original extent. \u000a<p>Only at High Park can you still get a glimpse of the variety of\u000ahabitats which once occurred throughout Toronto. It is our\u000aconnection to Toronto\u2019s wilderness past, but it has not escaped\u000aunscathed. It has lost more than half of its rare plant species\u000aover the last 90 years and one-third of its nesting bird species\u000aover the last 50 years, as well as many of its rare insect species\u000asuch as the Karner Blue butterfly. Despite the loss of natural\u000aareas to make way for other uses, High Park still supports a\u000aremarkable variety of rare flora and vegetation communities.</p>\u000a<p>High Park is the last sizeable natural area remaining on\u000aToronto\u2019s Iroquois Sand Plain. These sands were laid down on the\u000ashores of glacial Lake Iroquois, the larger version of Lake\u000aOntario, that was formed when the glaciers retreated from our area\u000aabout 12,800 years ago. The coarse, sandy soils are relatively warm\u000aand dry. This \u201cedaphic\u201d feature has allowed savannah plants to\u000asuccessfully colonize and expand their range well to the east of\u000athe traditional warm and dry prairies of central North America.</p>\u000a<p>The oak savannahs of High Park are considered \u201ccontinentally\u000asignificant\u201d by virtue of their location, at the northern edge of\u000athe geographic zone of occurrence, and the size, nature and\u000acharacteristics of the remnant ecological community they comprise.\u000aThese ecological features are nonetheless impoverished. For\u000aexample, the dominant Black Oak trees, over 150 years of age, are\u000anot regenerating. Regenerating is used rather than reproducing\u000abecause the oaks do set viable crops of acorns. It is from that\u000apoint onward that the life cycle of a Black Oak is impaired. At\u000aleast 50% of these Black Oaks are diseased or heart- rotted. In\u000arecent years, successive dry summers coupled with successive Fall\u000aCankerworm infestations have contributed to the demise of a\u000asubstantial fraction of these old oak trees. The Parks Department\u000ahas embarked on a program which includes acorn collection and\u000agermination as well as insect and squirrel population monitoring so\u000aas to curtail the demise of this tree species.</p>\u000a<p>As well as identifying eco-system features there should be an\u000aunderstanding of eco-system function. A function that is\u000acharacteristic to savannah is fire. The whole host of savannah\u000aflora and fauna are in some way fire-dependant. For instance, young\u000aBlack Oak trees tolerate fire by exhibiting a unique ability to\u000aresprout stems following top kill by fire, when their competition\u000acan not. Also, large Black Oak trees develop a fire resistant,\u000ainsulating bark which gives them a competitive advantage. The Parks\u000aDepartment recognizes the necessity of fire, and has thus conducted\u000aseveral controlled, or prescribed burns in the past few years.\u000aResults have been encouraging, and the Department will continue to\u000ause the services of professional fire practitioners for years to\u000acome.</p>\u000a<p>Forty species of the park\u2019s native plants are known to occur in\u000aonly four other places in Metro Toronto. Four of these species\u000a(Wood Betony, Shrubby St. John\u2019s-Wort, Wild Lupine and Cup-Plant)\u000aare known to occur in four other places in Canada. What we have in\u000aHigh Park is truly unique and rare.</p>\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>

VTTC access from Castle Frank subway station.\u000a\u000aBefore you go off on the hunt, look up the word for "mother" in a Finnish dictionary.\u000a\u000aYou don't have to do the questions in order. In fact, you may want to plan out your own order of doing them, based on which ones are closer to each other if you want to avoid hours of walking back and forth.\u000a\u000aFor each of the questions, fill in the number required in the blanks. If one of the digits of the answer coincides with a letter instead of a blank, then assign that letter to that digit. For example, if the answer 1882 goes in the blanks _ _ Y _, then Y = 8.\u000a\u000aIf there is more than one occurence of a letter, then add up all the values that letter receives. For example, if you must write down the year 1935 in the slot _ _ X _, and then later the number 12 in the slot _ X, then X would be equal to the sum of 3 and 2. X = 5. \u000a\u000aIf this sum is higher than 9 (more than one digit long), then add up its digits, for example if M comes up three times and its answers are 5, 3 and 9, then add them up to 17, then add up 1 and 7, so now you know that M = 8.\u000a\u000aFor the letters A, B, F and G there is only one answer to fill. For C and E, you will have to add up two digits. For D, there are 3 answers to add up.\u000a\u000aThe final cache is hidden at:\u000a43 degrees 40.ADC North\u000a79 degrees 2B.EFG West\u000a\u000aThe final is located approximately 100 metres from one of the three cemetery entrances/exits described in the waypoints.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Barnie's Band of Gold, who was first to find!!\u000a\u000aEnjoy!

In 1880, in London, England, he became the\u000aworld\u2019s professional rowing champion. Hanlan was born in Toronto,\u000aOntario. When his parents moved to Toronto Island, where his father\u000awas a hotel keeper, he had to cross Toronto Harbour to attend\u000aGeorge Street Public School on the mainland. The only way to reach\u000athe mainland was by boat. This daily crossing in all kinds of\u000aweather in his first boat, a scooped out wooden plank, gave the\u000ayoung Hanlan great confidence on the water</font></p>\u000a<p align="left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"\u000acolor="#000000"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">By the\u000atime he was 16, Hanlan was competing in local regattas on Toronto\u000aBay. When he was 18, he rowed his first shell and won the Toronto\u000aamateur sculling championship. At age 21, in 1876, Hanlan won in\u000athe Philadelphia Centennial Regatta, on the Schuylkill River,\u000aagainst 15 professionals and established a new world\u2019s record over\u000aa three-mile course for single sculls\u000acompetition.</font></font></p>\u000a<div align="center">\u000a<center><br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<table cellpadding="0" width="704" id="table1">\u000a<tr>\u000a<td valign="top">\u000a<p align="center"><img height="276"\u000asrc="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8058f7a2-1277-45e2-9c10-3c52764359dc.jpg" />\u000a</p>\u000a<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b>Artist Fredric Marlett\u000aBell-Smith painted the skyline in the background of this 1880 view\u000adepicting the new world champion sculler Ned Hanlan in the Toronto\u000aharbour as photographed by Thomas Hunter [C.J.

During\u000araces Hanlan would occasionally stop, wave impishly to spectators,\u000awash his face, even bend over to sponge water from his shell until\u000acompetitors caught up to him. Then he would put on a sprint and win\u000aeasily.<br />\u000a<font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">In 1878 Hanlan won the\u000aU.S. title on the Allegheny River, defeating all the best\u000achallengers.

Results were given to the crowds of people along the course\u000athrough loud speakers. The ever-present press were quick to publish\u000atheir stories. Although the English media lectured Hanlan on his\u000aflamboyancy, they appreciated his graceful rowing style.</font></p>\u000a<div align="center">\u000a<center>\u000a<table cellpadding="3" width="499" id="table2">\u000a<tr>\u000a<td><img height="285"\u000asrc="http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e86/rbarrick/GeoCache/NedHanlan1.jpg"\u000a     width="215" nosave="" /></td>\u000a<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b>Rare image and early\u000atobacco card (Allen &amp; Ginter's) illustrating world champion\u000asculler, Toronto's Ned Hanlan, circa 1880 [C.J.Humber\u000aCollection]</b></font></td></tr></table></center></div>\u000a<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">On November 15,\u000a1880, Hanlan defeated the world professional champion, E.A.\u000aTrickett of Australia, on England\u2019s Thames River course and became\u000athe world\u2019s champion sculler. Over the next several years Hanlan\u000asuccessfully defended his title six times <sup>__</sup> in Canada,\u000athe United States, and England. After giving demonstrations in\u000aHonolulu, he went to Australia in 1884. For two months he was feted\u000awith receptions and banquets and sculled only in warm-up races. On\u000athe Paramatta River in Sydney he finally lost his crown to the\u000aAustralian sculler, William Beach.</font></p>\u000a<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#000000">Hanlan continued to\u000arow well into the 1880s winning more than 300 races.

Then pair up each of these letters with the number ID\u000aof the tree.</p>\u000a<p>For example, if the answer to Tree 4 is "aardvark", then a=4.\u000aAnd if the answer "absinthe" came second in alphabetical sort (and\u000ait was from Tree 7), then b=7.

John\u000aHoward, one of Toronto\u2019s first architects as well as a City\u000aEngineer and Surveyor, built Colborne Lodge in 1837 which still\u000acontains many original furnishings, artifacts, and some of his own\u000awatercolours depicting images of early Toronto. Colborne Lodge\u2019s\u000aextensive ornamental and kitchen gardens are now being restored.\u000aTour the Lodge or come and enjoy the Harvest Festival, Christmas\u000acelebrations or celebrate Doors Open Toronto with the museum\u2019s\u000afriendly and knowledgeable staff.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b><font size="4">John Howard Tomb</font></b><br />\u000a<br />\u000aJohn Howard designed this tomb in High Park for his wife and\u000ahimself in 1874-75. (Jemima Howard died in 1877 and John passed\u000aaway in 1890). Like Colborne Lodge, this was a romantic structure,\u000abut it represented a heavy Victorian romanticism in contrast to the\u000alighter version articulated in his Regency lodge.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aJohn Howard married Jemima Frances Meikle in 1827. Jemima (1802-77)\u000asometimes prepared copies of specifications in John's architectural\u000aand engineering practice. She also was an amateur watercolourist,\u000abut did not document the city's life, focusing instead on romantic\u000aimages. The Howards' relationship seems to have been incomplete:\u000aJohn engaged in a long-term clandestine relationship with another\u000awoman, Mary Williams, with whom he had three children, whereas he\u000aand Jemima had none. Yet during Jemima's final illness - with\u000acancer - John did his utmost to find a cure and to care for her,\u000aand seems to have grieved her loss with deep sincerity.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<p>- - -<br />\u000a<br />\u000aA children's garden and small zoo are nearby.</p>

VWhat better place for a hide than right under the noses of the\u000aguards. Yes, you are being watched, so be cool, and act natural.\u000aThis is the (former) P4W, which closed about 10 years ago, and now\u000ahouses the <a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.penitentiarymuseum.ca/museum/museum_home.htm">PENITENTIARY\u000aMUSEUM</a>. The adjacent site, very close by to the north, has been\u000asold to Queen's University. To the south is the infamous Kingston\u000aPen, home to the worst criminals in Canada. All the structures on\u000athis property...buildings, fences, stonework, etc, were all built\u000aby inmates. \u000a<p>The site is open to the public. The vehicle entrance is off Sir\u000aJohn A MacDonald Blvd SOUTHBOUND ONLY, south of Union street, north\u000aof King Street. There is plenty of free car parking. The most\u000ainteresting way to GZ however, is the short walk from Portsmouth\u000aOlympic Harbour, just across the street (also plenty of free car\u000aparking). There is an ornate gate on King street, right across from\u000athe main entrance to Kingston Pen.</p>\u000a<p>The site has lots of green space and is kid and dog friendly. It\u000ais an easy 2 minute walk to GZ, no bushwacking. There is no snow\u000aremoval to GZ however, so snow can be a problem. This cache can be\u000adone in under 10 minutes. The museum, open during the summer\u000amonths, is excellent, and includes real jail cells (entrance fee is\u000aby donation, usually one coin).</p>\u000a<p>The walls of the prison have now been removed, the site cleaned\u000aup, and the construction/demolition ended. Access from Union street\u000ais now an interesting alternate route to the cache. There is a\u000apaved path at the extreme west end of the grounds, right below the\u000aone remaining wall. As you walk this path, see the remains of the\u000aprison, and try to imagine the women who once called this\u000ahome....spooky.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to Hypocorism on the FTF.<br />\u000aCongratulations also to all the others who braved the cold, wind,\u000asnow and dark to find this cache on Nov 30 for the FARE THEE WELL\u000aBN2 event</p>\u000a<p>FTF Hypocorism<br />\u000a2TF Bluesaway<br />\u000a3TF Cumbrian Lass<br />\u000a4TF Skottikus<br />\u000a5TF Remote Sensor + Greenleaf<br />\u000a6TF Team Jevre</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

VNO FENCES TO CLIMB...USE THE GATE (see photo below) \u000a<p>The cache is on the grounds of Corrections Canada Staff College.\u000aThe north side of the property is the DOG TRAINING AREA. It\u000aincludes an agility course and excercise yard. This is a popular\u000adog park. Remember to bring your canine friends.</p>\u000a<p>VISITORS (and their dogs) ARE WELCOME, provided they abide by\u000athe rules. In short, you (and your dog) must not bother or distract\u000aa dog in training. The complete text can be found in the picture\u000agallery.</p>\u000a<p>If you enter the grounds from UNION STREET, you will find plenty\u000aof parking AND the 3 historic houses which were moved from\u000aUniversity Ave by truck. If you aproach from the north, USE THE\u000aGATE just west of the ball diamond (see gallery...don't rip your\u000apants on the chain link fence like others before you). Either way,\u000aGZ is a short walk (200m) from parking. Deep snow will make access\u000adifficult.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is not on the ground, or even near the ground. It is\u000avisible from a short distance. It will be a physical challenge to\u000aget the cache once you see it. Please use caution getting the\u000acache. If in doubt, leave it...it's just a game. Do not try to get\u000athis cache in icy/slippery/wet conditions. You do not have to\u000aretrieve the cache yourself, but to log as a find, you must get\u000ayour name into the log book, somehow.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to Hypocorism on the FTF on a cold and snowy\u000anight.<br />\u000a Honourable mention must also go to George (of BN2), and\u000aGuardian14.<br />\u000a Although there are other names in the log, these are the first\u000aMONKEYS who braved the elements to actually retrieve the cache.\u000aWell done!</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

VThis cache is dedicated to all those who have served and currently serve under the Signals (Jimmy) capbadge. A nice place to go visit after you find the cache. Small enough for some small items. Might be an easy find. :) If you find this cache during the day - please take some time and visit the building nearby. Free admission and lots of neat and interesting displays. Besides you can even press red buttons. You know you want to find out what the red button does. \u000a\u000ahere's the link to the nearby building.

V<p>When a bunch of cachers in the Kingston area got together, a\u000adiscussion ensued that the Kingston Area Geocachers (KAG) should\u000adevelop a logo. It was felt that the logo should be simple, yet\u000acapture some unique identification of Kingston. Although I am not\u000aan artist by any stretch of the imagination, I do love an excuse to\u000aplay around with new computer programs.</p>\u000a<p>This is what I came up with:</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img border="0" src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c0f21d12-98b9-47be-ba6b-dfbdc888fa51.jpg">\u000a</a></center>\u000a<p>Whether I succeeded to capture a unique K-town identity, I'll\u000aleave you to decide. But wait! <i>What if I could hide a cache\u000aright inside the logo?</i></p>\u000a<p>Members of KAG have shown themselves to be adventurous, and open\u000ato new challenges. You might have to explore some new skills to\u000afind this cache. But with a little homework and a few steps, you\u000awill be able to find it. <i>There is an unactivated geocoin for the\u000aFTF.</i></p>\u000a<p>Please don't post any spoilers in the logs. Let everyone have\u000athe chance to see if this logo does an adequate job!</p>\u000a<p>You can check your answers for this puzzle <a target="_blank"\u000ahref=\u000a"http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=7aa057d035d0c1868c28c13507874eb8&amp;action=check&amp;wp=474331355a434e&amp;name=43616e20596f75205069637475726520546869733f&amp;language=">\u000ahere</a>.</p>\u000a<center><strong>Congratulations to Remote Sensor on the\u000aFTF!</strong></center>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a \u000a<center><a href="http://www.ontgeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erconnell/images/ogalink.gif" width="250"\u000aheight="106" border="0"></a></center>

VThe cache is a micro (film canister). There is a log book and a first to find prize inside! A small pencil is also included, but its better to bring your own pen or pencil just in case. A short walk after parking is required, but its a nice, easy walk. Check road-side parking restrictions before parking!\u000a\u000aCongrats Guardian14 on the FTF ... at 3AM.  Nice Job!

VEasy find at a fast food joint. It is camo'd not hidden. No need to\u000amove any rocks or lift anything. It is not on the ground but it is\u000afairly low. It is not a skirtlifter. \u000a<p>Celebrate your find with a happy meal, or drown your DNF sorrows\u000ain a McFlurry.</p>\u000a<p>In 1954, 52-year-old salesman Ray Kroc was a distributor for\u000a"Multimixer" milkshake machines when he came across the small\u000ahamburger stand of Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino,\u000aCalifornia. The McDonald brothers didn't want to oversee any new\u000arestaurants, so Kroc became their franchising agent. Kroc formed\u000athe franchising company on March 2, 1955, under the name of\u000aMcDonald's System, Inc.</p>\u000a<p>There are about 31,000 McDonald's worldwide.</p>\u000a<p>On May 3, 2000, Dave Ulmer hid a bucket of trinkets in the woods\u000aoutside Portland, Oregon and announced its location on the\u000ainternet. Mike Teague was FTF, exclaiming "Woo-Hoo, there should be\u000alike a special prize for FTF". Within days there were caches hidden\u000aacross the USA. On May 8, 2000, Teague made a Web site for\u000acollecting the locations of caches.</p>\u000a<p>There are almost 1 million geocaches worldwide.</p>\u000a<p>Today these two global phenomena converge as McCache!</p>\u000a<p>Takes 5 minutes or less. Watch out for cars at GZ. Street\u000aparking very close, or free parking a few metres north of GZ at\u000aBlockbuster Video. Easy, flat terrain.</p>\u000a<p>They named one of their special BIG hamburgers after one of the\u000abrothers. It's a good thing they didn't name it after the other\u000abrother!</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to:<br />\u000aFTF Swimmrguy<br />\u000a2TF Bluesaway<br />\u000a3TF GlenburnieHawkeye</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

Good luck! Just be\u000aaware that the cache container is extremely small and there are\u000aloads of places where it could be hidden. Oh, and don&rsquo;t look\u000aat the cache&rsquo;s Gallery until after you&rsquo;ve found\u000ait!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aIf you&rsquo;re the sort of cacher who enjoys the thrill of finding\u000aa cache, though without having to spend hours and hours searching\u000afor it (and we place ourselves firmly in this camp)... the hints\u000awill help you locate the container, though stop short of telling\u000ayou precisely where it is. Well, there&rsquo;s got to be a little\u000abit of a challenge, hasn&rsquo;t there?!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease be aware that whilst the cache seems to be available for\u000amost of the winter, the City puts up barriers that prevent access\u000aafter heavy snowfalls.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b>Sorry for the full log.

Not to put that\u000alovely little hamlet down, but Kingston can boast a few such gems\u000aof its own. Each unique and interesting in its own way; rich in\u000aart, architecture and history. I chose a few, within easy walking\u000adistance of downtown Kingston. There are many more nearby which you\u000amay wish to visit. It may be very interesting to learn more about\u000aKingston churches from the web. The stories and names read like a\u000ahistory of Upper Canada. Don\u2019t cheat yourself out of the full\u000aexperience by rushing through this tour. Stop long enough to take\u000ain such notables as the oldest churchyard cemetery in the district,\u000aor the canon that helped protect Protestantism in Britain.\u000aCertainly enjoy the sights, sounds, ambiance, and the many and\u000avaried other buildings in the Limestone City.</p>\u000a<p>THE TOUR</p>\u000a<p>You will visit 12 churches, all within about a km of the\u000adowntown core. At each, you will gather information (readily\u000aaccessed from the sidewalk) to be used to determine the location of\u000athe next church. The 13th stop is the final cache containing log\u000asheet and pencil. It is hidden a couple m from a roadway, across\u000aflat lawn, in the boughs of an evergreen tree, at waist height. The\u000acomplete 2¾ km tour is arranged to minimize distance.</p>\u000a<p>THE LOCATIONS</p>\u000a<p>Church 1:<br />\u000aAt the cornerstone (the posted coordinates) find the year the\u000achurch was erected (not the year enlarged).<br />\u000aSubtract 1801 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1774 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the posted north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the posted west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 2.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 2:<br />\u000aAt the base of the flagpole find the year the flagpole was\u000adonated.<br />\u000aSubtract 1916 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1885 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 2 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 2 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 3.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 3:<br />\u000aOn the wall above the arched main doorway, find the four-digit date\u000a(in two parts).<br />\u000aSubtract 1700 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1874 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 3 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 3 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 4.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 4:<br />\u000aFind the year above the main door.<br />\u000aSubtract 1810 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1617 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 4 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 4 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 5.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 5:<br />\u000aFind the year in the stained glass above the main door.<br />\u000a Subtract 1838 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1842 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000a*Subtract n from the Church 5 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 5 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 6.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 6:<br />\u000aAt the bottom of the clock tower find the year the church was\u000aoriginally built.<br />\u000aSubtract 1720 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1668 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 6 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 6 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 7.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 7:<br />\u000aFind the year on the painted sign on the front lawn.<br />\u000a Subtract 1856 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1754 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 7 north coordinates.<br />\u000a Subtract w from the Church 7 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 8.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 8:<br />\u000aOn the grey stone slab on the front lawn, find the earliest date\u000a(when the church began to be erected).<br />\u000aSubtract 1823 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1724 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 8 north coordinates.<br />\u000aSubtract w from the Church 8 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 9.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 9:<br />\u000aOn the cornerstone near the front door, find the year.<br />\u000aSubtract 1875 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1904 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 9 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 9 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 10.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 10:<br />\u000aFind the 2-digit brass number on the wall near the wheelchair\u000aaccess door.<br />\u000aSubtract 25 from this number to get n.<br />\u000a*Add 96 to this number to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 10 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 10 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 11.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 11:<br />\u000aOn the cornerstone above the main door, choose the earlier of the\u000atwo dates shown.<br />\u000aSubtract 1765 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1812 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 11 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 11 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 12.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 12:<br />\u000aOn the stone monolith, on the lawn, find the year of the original\u000astructure.<br />\u000aSubtract 1666 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1642 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 12 north coordinates.<br />\u000aSubtract w from the Church 12 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of the Final Cache.)</p>\u000a<p>Please be stealthy and replace exactly as found.

VWelcome to a Parks Canada Earthcache. Earthcaches are located at\u000aspecial geological or geomorphological features. There are no\u000alogbooks, no Tupperware containers, and no trade items at an\u000aEarthCache\u2026just a cool lesson in natural sciences, waiting to be\u000alearned and passed along. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe only constant thing in nature is change. Given enough time,\u000anothing stays the same. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aWetlands are areas that are covered in water for at least part of\u000athe year. There are several types of wetlands, which include:\u000aponds, marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. Ponds have a well-defined\u000ashoreline and are dominated by aquatic plants (\u201csea weeds\u201d) and\u000afloating vegetation (such as lilies). Marshes have open water that\u000ais either standing or slow-moving and are dominated by emergent\u000avegetation, such as cattails and rushes. Swamps are basically a\u000aflooded forest and are dominated by trees. Bogs have very little\u000aopen water, are dominated by mosses, and the ground is actually\u000apeat (compressed and semi-rotten plant material), which acts as a\u000agiant water sponge. Lastly there are fens, which are very similar\u000ato bogs, except that they have a greater variety of plants, and are\u000adominated by sedges and hardy grasses. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aRegardless of what you call them, wetlands are vital to the health\u000aof many larger ecosystems and are often very high in biodiversity\u000a(the number of different species in an area). One of the important\u000aroles wetlands play is as a filter. For example, the plants in a\u000apond slow the flow of the stream that feeds it, especially after\u000astorms and spring thaw. When the stream slows down, it can\u2019t carry\u000aas much sediment and these bits of soil, stone, and other materials\u000athen collect along the bottom of the pond. All these sediments\u000acontain lots of nutrients for many different types of plants. As\u000apond plants die, they add to the layers at the bottom of the pond.\u000aOver time, all that plant material and sediment from the river or\u000astream builds up and the pond becomes very shallow. Eventually,\u000athere is no open water left and what was a pond becomes a meadow.\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aHistorically, wetlands have had been undervalued by people. The\u000asoils are rich, but are waterlogged, so wetlands have been drained\u000ato make room for fields and farms. In many places, wetlands have\u000abeen filled in to build houses, office buildings, and factories.\u000aPollution carried by streams and rivers has settled in wetlands,\u000aimpacting their health.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFortunately, people are finally beginning to understand how\u000aimportant wetlands are to the health of the greater ecosystem. Many\u000apeople are now working together to help protect wetlands and all\u000athe plants and animals that depend on them, including humans.\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aTo log this EarthCache, determine which of the 5 wetland types you\u000acan see in the picture below (of the wetland many years ago) and at\u000athe site and tell me how you came to those conclusions. Email me at\u000aont-sli@pc.gc.ca with your answers and a picture of you at the\u000asite. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<p align="center">\u000a&nbsp;<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/80afe0e1-4929-4dc6-bac7-bba9358841c8.jpg"\u000a     width="576" height="432" /></p>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aBienvenue dans une géocachette de Parcs Canada! Les géocachettes\u000asont situées dans des caractéristiques géologiques,\u000agéomorphologiques ou écologiques spéciales. On n\u2019y trouve pas de\u000acarnet, ni de plat Tupperware, ni d\u2019objet à échanger\u2026 seulement une\u000aleçon branchée sur les sciences naturelles qui attend que vous la\u000adécouvriez et la transmettiez. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aDans la nature, le changement est la seule constante. Tout évolue à\u000ason propre rythme. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aLes milieux humides sont des surfaces couvertes d\u2019eau pendant au\u000amoins une partie de l\u2019année. Il existe plusieurs types de milieux\u000ahumides : les étangs, les marais, les marécages, les tourbières\u000ahautes et les tourbières basses. Les étangs possèdent un rivage\u000abien défini. Les plantes aquatiques (« plantes marines ») et la\u000avégétation flottante (comme les nénuphars) y dominent. Les marais\u000asont situés dans des eaux libres stagnantes ou à débit très lent.\u000aLa végétation émergente (comme les quenouilles et les joncs) y est\u000adominante. Les marécages sont en fait des forêts inondées où les\u000aarbres dominent. Les tourbières ombrotrophes (bogs) ont très peu\u000ad\u2019eaux libres. On y trouve surtout de la mousse poussant sur un\u000aterrain constitué de tourbe (un matériau végétal comprimé et à demi\u000adécomposé) qui agit à la façon d\u2019une éponge géante. Enfin, les\u000atourbières minérotrophes (fens) sont très semblables aux tourbières\u000aombrotrophes, mais on y trouve une plus grande variété de plantes\u000aparmi lesquelles les carex et les graminées rustiques\u000adominent.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a Peu importe leur type, les milieux humides sont essentiels à la\u000asanté de nombreux grands écosystèmes et sont souvent riches en\u000abiodiversité (c\u2019est-à-dire qu\u2019ils abritent de nombreuses espèces\u000adifférentes). L\u2019un des rôles les plus importants des milieux\u000ahumides est de servir de filtre : par exemple, les plantes d\u2019un\u000aétang ralentissent le débit du ruisseau qui l\u2019alimente, surtout\u000aaprès un orage ou lors du dégel printanier. Lorsque le débit est\u000aralenti, la quantité de sédiments transportés est moins grande, et\u000ales débris de sol, de pierres et d\u2019autres matières se déposent au\u000afond de l\u2019étang. Tous ces sédiments contiennent de nombreux\u000anutriments utiles à différentes plantes. Au fur et à mesure que les\u000avégétaux de l\u2019étang meurent, ils s\u2019ajoutent aux couches qui forment\u000ale fond de l\u2019étang. Au fil du temps, toutes les matières végétales\u000aet les sédiments apportés par la rivière ou le ruisseau\u000as\u2019accumulent et l\u2019étang devient de moins en moins profond, jusqu\u2019à\u000ace qu\u2019un jour il ne reste plus d\u2019eau; l\u2019étang devient alors un\u000apré.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a Le rôle des milieux humides a longtemps été sous-estimé. Leur sol\u000ariche, mais saturé d\u2019eau, était souvent drainé pour permettre\u000al\u2019agriculture et la construction de fermes. À de nombreux endroits,\u000aon les a remblayés pour construire des maisons, des immeubles à\u000abureaux et des usines. La pollution transportée par les cours d\u2019eau\u000aet les rivières s\u2019est établie dans les milieux humides, mettant en\u000apéril leur santé. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aHeureusement, on commence à comprendre leur importance pour la\u000asanté des grands écosystèmes. De nos jours, de nombreuses personnes\u000acollaborent pour assurer leur protection ainsi que celle de tous\u000ales organismes vivants qui en dépendent, y compris les êtres\u000ahumains.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPour enregistrer cette géocachette, déterminez lequel des cinq\u000atypes de milieu humide vous voyez dans l'image ici (le milieu\u000ahumide, il y a quelques années) et sur le site et dites-moi comment\u000avous êtes arrivé à cette conclusion.

VWelcome to a Parks Canada Earthcache. Earthcaches are located at special geological or geomorphological features. There are no logbooks, no Tupperware containers, and no trade items at an EarthCache\u2026just a cool lesson in natural sciences, waiting to be learned and passed along.\u000a\u000aTime is a relative construct. To you and me, a decade is a long time. For these rocks, time is measured in hundreds and millions of years. The rock here is a mix of igneous and metamorphic rocks common throughout the Frontenac Axis, a branch of the Canadian Shield. These rocks were formed and shaped deep in the roots of the mountains that once stood here a billion years ago. Since then, erosion has worn away the towering mountain chain that once stood higher than the Rockies do today, over 5,000 metres. As the rocks initially cooled, and then as the weight above them gradually disappeared, fractures called joints appeared. Here the joints lie in an east-west and north-south pattern.\u000a\u000aIce, in the form of the Wisconsin Ice Sheet, polished and plucked the local bedrock into numerous tear-drop shaped hills and outcroppings, known as roche moutonnées, seen among the islands and hills of this area of the Axis. As the ice moved across the highly variable rock formations, with its gritty, rock-laden bottom, it gouged out grooves and troughs in the softer rocks and polished the harder more resistant ones. Typically, as the ice oozed over a resistant rock ridge, it polished the \u2018up-stream\u2019 side (the north-east side) and plucked or pulled away chunks of rock from the down-stream side (south-west). Here, the local jointing pattern of north-south and east-west caused the rocks to break off more parallel to the flow of the ice.\u000a\u000aLastly, around 10,000 years ago, the ice started to melt away. The ice front that had taken many tens of thousands of years to advance was melting back faster than its glacial ice was flowing forward. Enormous meltwater lakes were forming along the southern edge of the retreating ice sheet. The Lake Ontario basin was much fuller and deeper than it is now, and is referred to as Lake Iroquois. Meltwater was saturated with glacial sediments of abrasive rock and as it surged down a maze of streams along the edge of the ice, it eroded the cliffs and rocky stretches of the shoreline. \u000a\u000aHere a section of softer rock that formed a billion years ago in the heart of a mountain, exposed over hundreds of millions of years of erosion and shaped by glacial flow, was finally given its finishing touch of smoothing and polishing by fast flowing water a mere 10,000 years ago. We can stand high and dry beside this very unique linear feature, a side-wise trough, which shows the marks of processes that occurred long ago.\u000a\u000aTo log this EarthCache, note how the different sections of the rock host many different types of plants, mosses, and lichens and describe at least 4 (name them if you can). Email me at ont-sli@pc.gc.ca with your answers and a picture of you at the "rock wave". \u000a\u000aBienvenue dans une géocachette de Parcs Canada! Les géocachettes sont situées dans des caractéristiques géologiques ou géomorphologiques spéciales. On n\u2019y trouve pas de carnet, ni de plat Tupperware, ni d\u2019objet à échanger\u2026 seulement une leçon branchée sur les sciences naturelles qui attend que vous la découvriez et la transmettiez.\u000a\u000aLe temps est un concept relatif. Pour vous et moi, une décennie, c\u2019est long. Pour ces rochers, le temps se compte en centaines et en millions d\u2019années. \u000a\u000aOn trouve ici un mélange de roches ignées et métamorphiques propre à l\u2019axe de Frontenac, une section du Bouclier canadien. Elles se sont formées à une grande profondeur sous des montagnes qui se trouvaient à cet endroit il y a un milliard d\u2019années. Depuis ce temps, l\u2019érosion a rongé l\u2019imposante chaîne de montagne qui s\u2019élevait autrefois à une hauteur plus élevée que celle des Rocheuses actuelles (plus de 5000 mètres). Les roches se sont refroidies et le poids qu\u2019elles supportaient a progressivement disparu, créant des fractures, appelées joints. Ces joints ont adopté une structure formée de deux axes : un axe est-ouest et un axe nord-sud. \u000a\u000aLa glace de la calotte glaciaire du Wisconsin a poli et sculpté le substrat rocheux, y laissant de nombreuses collines en forme de larmes et des affleurements, connus sous le nom de « roches moutonnées », que l\u2019on retrouve sur les îles et les collines de cette région de l\u2019axe. La glace s\u2019est déplacée à travers les formations rocheuses changeantes; son fond graveleux, chargé de roches, a façonné des cannelures et des fossés tectoniques dans les roches tendres et a poli les roches résistantes. Habituellement, lorsque la glace se déplaçait sur une crête résistante, elle polissait le versant « en amont » (versant nord-est) et arrachait des fragments rocheux sur le versant « en aval » (versant sud-ouest). Ici, en raison de la jonction de l\u2019axe nord-sud et de l\u2019axe est-ouest, les roches se sont détachées parallèlement à l\u2019écoulement glaciaire. \u000a\u000aEnfin, il y a environ 10 000 ans, la glace a commencé à fondre. Le front glaciaire, dont l\u2019avancée avait nécessité plusieurs dizaines de milliers d\u2019années, a fondu à un rythme plus rapide que celui de l\u2019écoulement du glacier. D\u2019énormes lacs d\u2019eau de fonte se sont formés le long de la frontière sud de la calotte glaciaire qui se retirait. Le bassin du lac Ontario était beaucoup plus rempli et profond qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui \u2013 on désigne aujourd\u2019hui cet ancien lac par le nom de lac Iroquois. L\u2019eau de fonte était saturée de sédiments glaciaires composés de roches d\u2019érosion et, alors qu\u2019elle s\u2019écoulait en un labyrinthe de cours d\u2019eau le long de la frontière de la calotte glaciaire, elle érodait les falaises et les passages rocheux du littoral.\u000a\u000aUne section de roches tendres formées il y a un milliard d\u2019années au c\u0153ur de la montagne, qui ont été exposées pendant plusieurs centaines de millions d\u2019années à l\u2019érosion et façonnées par l\u2019écoulement glaciaire, a finalement reçu sa touche de finition et de polissage par l\u2019eau en mouvement il y a seulement 10 000 ans. Nous pouvons, bien au sec, observer cette caractéristique linéaire vraiment unique, un fossé tectonique latéral, témoignant de processus très anciens.\u000a\u000aPour enregistrer cette géocachette, notez les divers types de plantes, de mousses et de lichens qu\u2019abritent les différentes sections des roches, en plus d\u2019en décrire au moins quatre (nommez-les si vous le pouvez). Envoyez-moi un courriel à ont-sli@pc.gc.ca avec vos réponses et une photo de vous sur les lieux. >.

VHarold Town was an extremely recognized and honoured artist in his time, however the average person might not know who he was! The location of the cache will reveal all. His studio was in the building that you see, right by the subway tracks, if you are travelling between Yorkville Geo-walk #1 and 2. \u000aThe location rates 3.5 on a Muggle scale of 5. Stealth is key.\u000a\u000aPark as per my notes on Yorkville Geo-walk #1, or at Canadian Tire (that's a big spoiler) if you plan to shop too.\u000a\u000aPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not leave anything, however small, in the cache. There's only room for the log.\u000a\u000aPLEASE NOTE: There is lots of building interference in this area. Coords here are hit and miss, as I read logs. Sometimes spot on, sometimes not. The park sign is HIGHLY visible to lead you to the 'right' side... and the clue says it all. So don't let the GPSr take you across towards the car wash!

VIt is easy to access satellite imagery on the web.  This access provides great benefits to geocaching, and the public at large.  The discipline that is dedicated to the processing of satellite images is known as Remote Sensing.  The cache is not at the listed coordinates, they are for the  Remote Sensing laboratory at the Royal Military College of Canada.\u000a\u000aThe images that you can download from the Internet are usually in a \u201ctrue colour\u201d format.  This means that the image has been modified to emulate a colour photograph.  The general public is used to viewing a true colour image, thus it is an ideal product for web dissemination.  However, a true colour image holds little benefit for a professional analyst.  Earth observation satellites are capable of scanning outside of the EM spectrum, beyond visible range; the portion of the spectrum that yields the most information for a Remote Sensor.\u000a\u000aTo find the cache you will have to do some remote sensing research on the Internet, some analysis of typical RS images, and some legwork.\u000a\u000a\u000aImage 1-Thermal\u000aThis is a thermal image of Kingston.  In this image; bright areas indicate ground that is relatively warmer then other areas in the image.  You must figure out what is happening at the bright white line indicated by the cross-hair and circle.  The answer is one word.  Spell out the word and then convert it to numbers using the phone pad.   The number that you get is \u2018A\u2019. \u000a\u000aImage 2 a and b-Unsupervised Classification\u000aThese images of Kingston are a standard product of remote sensing.  They are a pseudo-colour image produced by statistically grouping similar spectral signatures.  Each colour represents a distinctive landcover.  Travel to the location indicated by the cross-hair and circle, in the middle of the red box.  The red pixels indicate that this object is spectrally different than its surroundings.  Also, the object is not square, the pixels are arranged in a grid and the red ones are the ones that cover the object.  Read the large 3 digit number on one side of the object.  This number is data \u2018B\u2019.\u000a\u000aInternet\u000aCanada is a leader in one type of satellite remote sensing.  The second model of this satellite type was launched successfully into space aboard a Soyuz rocket on December 14, 2007.   Find out the generic acronym for the sensor used on this satellite.  Convert to numbers, again using the phone pad, to get \u2018C\u2019.  \u000a\u000a\u000aImages 3a and b NDVI\u000aImage 3 is a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image of a section of Kingston, Ontario.  The NDVI is produced by ratioing together the Red and Near Infrared portions of the spectrum.  The benefit of a NDVI is that it shows vegetation stress; brighter areas indicate healthy vegetation, darker areas indicate stressed or non-vegetated areas.   The image was scanned in the early spring before the trees had their leaves, but the grass was healthy.  Using this knowledge and orienting yourself from landmarks in the image, seek out the source of the dark spot marked by the cross-hair and circle.  Here you will find an object with a yellow letter on it.  Use the phone pad to convert this letter to a number.  Then multiply the number by 100.  The result is \u2018D\u2019.  Visit this location last, as the cache is located in the same area.\u000a\u000aLocation\u000aDisregard the decimal and:\u000a\u000a3684695+A+B=North coordinate   \u000a7635492+C+D=West coordinate    \u000a\u000aCheck the final coordinates here:\u000ahttp://tinyurl.com/km2uh

VThe general area where you find the cache was once a fairly large estate owned by Chief Justice William Draper, who came to Upper Canada in 1820. \u000aHe rose in the ranks to become Chief Justice by 1863. \u000aTake time to read more about Draper on the descriptive panel at the corner of Hazeldean Park. \u000aDon't forget to first visit Memories of Severn Creek Park, the now-official start point of this geo-tour. Use the same parking hints for that cache.\u000aCan you imagine there was a creek flowing where you now see cars heading down Rosedale Valley Road toward Bayview Avenue?\u000aCan you also imagine that there was a bridge crossing the creek to connect Hazeldean with its then-neighbour estate Rosedale?\u000aEven if you live in Toronto I bet you will learn at least 1 thing you never knew before!\u000aThe cache is an economy-size vitamin bottle camod with black tape but the lid is green.\u000aPlease cover it well when you replace it. \u000a\u000aElectroQTed has reported coords at N 43° 40.378 W 079° 23.045, give these a whack and let me know if they continue to be closer. I seem to find the summer canopy has presented me with less precise coords captures than for caches I placed in the spring.

VRoute 113, also known as The Pequawket Trail, runs from the Ossipee Trail on the southern end to the center of Fryeburg.  It is about 30 miles long and has very few caches along it.  I am establishing the Pequawket Trail Cache Bonanza to remedy that situation.   I will place a few caches along the trail to get things going.  Each cache will be designated PTCB Mile # wherein the number represents the over the road miles from the intersection with Ossipee Trail heading North.  For example, if a cache is 5.6 miles from the Ossipee Trail, it would be designated PTCB Mile 5.6.  From thereon it is up to you guys to fill in the rest of the trail.\u000a\u000aYou may place any type of hide that you wish (traditional, multi, puzzle, nano, micro, small, regular or large) however to be part of the Cache Bonanza I would ask that the cache be within ¼ mile of the Pequawket Trail and capable of being done in fifteen minutes or less.  As these caches get filled in, simply follow the naming convention above and copy this information into your description.  If you would like me to e-mail it to you, I can do that.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO TRAIL MONGERS FOR THE FIRST TO FIND!!

VThis is #22 in the series of caches along this rail trail. Some are easy, some are hard, some are winter friendly, some are not. Since the North country is now in the grip of winter we thought it would be a good time to add some winter friendly caches to the trail. The trail has been packed down by the snowmobilers so walking on the trail is easy now. Just be wary of the snowmobilers.

VPark at designated coordinates. Carefully walk to the starting coordinates. You will have to climb over some riff raff to get there. Starting point is identified by a 1" yellow reflector. Once here shine your light down Old Rt #3. You will see a trail of fire tacks. Follow this trail CAREFULLY stepping over downed trees. You may notice a real nice Glacial Erratic standing on its end to your right part way down this trail. Once you cross a small brook that passes under the trail through a culvert you will see two 1" red reflectors surrounded by fire tacks. Here you must shine your lights into the trees along side the trail. HINT...look up!  Once you spotted a  white reflector make your way (climb) to it. Once there, look for an X made out of fire tacks. Cache is close by covered by natural camouflage.

VCache is a small match stick container just hanging out.  Not only was this cache placed on Christmas eve but it is day 42 and cache 42 of my goal to place a cache a day.  This day was very tempting to quit.  It was a really cold blizzard filled evening.  I was drenched and shivering by the time I made it back to the truck after placing and marking the cords for this cache.  I have many fond memories of this area from when I was a teenager.  Enjoy!  :]

VWe really enjoy this River Walk and thought it would be nice if there were more family type caches hidden along it. We believe that these are easy finds, and hope you do too.  It was difficult to get any consistent and accurate readings in all the trees and a cloudy rainy day,  but we checked them several times and did our best . The name is a clue and if you need a little more help because of difficulty of good GPS readings the hint should be of some help.  Enjoy!!!

VThe Little Spokane River rises in southern Pend Oreille County, south of Newport near the Idaho state line. It then flows south/southwest past Milan and Colbert, Washington. It joins with the Spokane River from the east, approximately 10 miles northwest of the City of Spokane.\u000a\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/cache/1227e862-fad1-4c65-89fa-d4a09302f100.jpg alt=""\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNorth of the City of Spokane groundwater in the Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer flows in a northward direction toward the Little Spokane River, following the ancestral channel of the Spokane River. Unconsolidated sediments have filled this channel (referred to as the Hillyard Trough) to a depth of over 700 feet. Several large capacity springs are dispersed over an approximate two mile wide area along the interface between the Hillyard Trough and the Little Spokane River Valley. This area has been recognized as a primary regional discharge zone for the Spokane Valley ' Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. The springs typically discharge 30 to 100 feet above the Little Spokane River, and are fed by groundwater from the Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. Stream flow in the Little Spokane River increases approximately 250 cfs (Cubic feet per second) over this reach of the river, in response to the groundwater discharge.\u000a\u000aThe Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer within the Hillyard Trough historically has been described as a single, largely unconfined unit, developed within unconsolidated Quaternary flood deposits. Hydrogeologic investigations and literature review conducted in support of two Spokane area wellhead protection projects have provided evidence of a deep, areally extensive, confined aquifer that extends from the north Hillyard Trough into the lower reaches of the Little Spokane River Valley. This secondary, deeper aquifer is present within the north Hillyard Trough at depths of 300 to 500 feet below ground, and is overlain by 150 to 200 feet of low permeability sediments. These low permeability sediments are typically encountered between elevation 1450 and 1650 FAMSL beneath both the Hillyard Trough and Little Spokane River Valley, and may represent remnants of a glaciolacustrine (lakebed) deposit. Within the Little Spokane River Valley, the deep confined aquifer system is encountered at depths of approximately 100 to 150 feet below the valley floor.\u000a\u000aThis earthcache will bring you to the Little Spokane River where it flows through the Haynes Estate Conservation Area, which is maintained by the Spokane County Parks and Recreation Department. \u000a\u000aYou can reach the Haynes Estate Conservation Area from the east or the west. Coordinates for both entry locations are posted.\u000a\u000aTo receive credit for this Earthcache, you must complete the following 3 requirements.\u000a\u000a1) Upload a picture of yourself at the posted coordinates with the Little Spokane River as your background.  Please also describe any wild life you saw while visiting this earthcache.\u000a\u000a2) Determine the flow rate in "Feet Per Second" for the Little Spokane River.\u000a\u000aThis may be done by measuring & marking a distance along the different river bank, then tossing in a leaf upriver from your starting point. With a stop watch, time how long it takes your leaf to complete your measured distance course. Then calculate that into "Feet Per Second" for the river.\u000a\u000a3) Estimate how deep the river is at the bend and how wide it is at the bend.\u000a\u000aYour picture must be posted with your log entry and your answeres E-MAILED to the cache owner.\u000a\u000aMartin 5\u000aPlatinum Level EarthCache Masters\u000a\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/91a49b5b-b6f4-4895-b270-dd64314a9a63.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/6599a5b8-3f32-456d-9705-eaf131e7aa57.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/4a08d1bf-21b5-4176-a727-2a121ffbf72f.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/bb4abe93-0c11-44e6-b35f-792c2a3d7449.jpg alt=""\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Trev of The Steaks for FTF on this EarthCache on the same day it was published!! \u000a\u000aFor more information about the aquifer see the following earthcache: The Rathdrum Prairie - Spokane Aquifer, by Three Bottles (GC1AA9M).\u000a\u000aFor more information about the Spokane River see the following earthcache: Fort Sherman, by Martin 5 (GC1HGAW).

VWe put the starting coordinates on the highway to help in accessing the trail head (High Rim trail). There is no parking lot, but ample room to park on side of hwy,or just a 100 meters or so up the hwy.on Philpot Rd. This is our first cache hide and our hopes are to keep any trades of a positive nature in some way benefitting ones' physical,mental or spiritual growth. (Can be anything inspirational/educational or personal you would like to share. Our cache is a white approx.2.5 litre pail which will probably turn green come summer. We left an inspirational notebook,inspirational keychain,a pamphlet called inner compass exercise to help attract wealth , a snowball candle, an issues magazine,a meditation cd,(very nice) and a very interesting documentary dvd. our wish is that if you take the dvd that you watch it but pass it on to another cache for others to see. We would also appreciate if you log on as the holder of the dvd you could add a note as to what cache you left it in. Thank you.

VThe area is full of many different trails all leading in the same\u000ageneral area. You may want to take the trail head co-ordinates\u000aprovided, just so you start on the right trail. Look for an exposed\u000awater line on the trail and follow it for a bit eventually taking a\u000atrail to your right. This will take you to the spot which is the\u000areason for the 4.0 difficulty rating. The bridge you will see in\u000afront of you is used for scout training purposes. PLEASE USE\u000aCAUTION! I don't recommend this for little kids. The cache is on\u000athe other side of this bridge.

There is a FTF prize consisting of a $10.00 Canadian Tire gift certificate.\u000a\u000aThe cache contains a log book only so you will need to bring your own pen or pencil to sign it.\u000a\u000aI have increased the difficulty rating to 3.5 and have decided not to give another clue just yet. I have checked the co-ords several times and have gotten slightly different readings, but overall, the co-ords are fairly accurate. \u000a\u000aStealth may be required at times so please keep an eye out for muggles. \u000a\u000aHappy Geocaching and Good Luck!!!

VThe LeRoi Gold Mine Tour is the only tour like it in all of Canada. The tour takes you undergroumd into what was once a working mine shaft and see how mining was done in the early 1900\u2019s. The tours are open May1st- Sept 1st each year. Tours go every hour and a half  through the day starting at 9:30 am with the last tour leaving at 3:30pm sharp. The constant underground temperature is 55 F, which is quite refreshing on a really hot day, but if you get cold easy you may want to bring along a jacket or take one of the blankets provided. Although to get credit for this cache you do not need to take the tour, I highly recommend the tour to people of all ages. Kids love to try to pan for GOLD after the tour is over. \u000a\u000aLeRoi Gold Mine History:\u000aIn the 1890\u2019s \u000aThe LeRoi mine was one of five claims staked on Red Mountain. It was bought for $12.50 and eventually was sold for 3 million dollars. The LeRoi mine became the most famous of the five claims and produced almost 30 million dollars. In 1911 the five original mines were consolidated and bought by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company later known as Cominco. Cominco later changed there name to Teck Cominco and as of June 1st, 2009 will be known only as Teck.\u000a \u000aHow Gold is formed:\u000a\u000aGold is formed as the result of molten rock, called magma, being intruded into solid rock.  As the magma cools and solidifies, water and other volatile substances separate out from the magma under high pressure.  The high pressure of hot water and steam force open fissures in the surrounding solid rock, through which these hydrothermal solutions travel.  When the hydrothermal solutions cool, deposition of material occurs, especially quartz in the form of quartz veins. Because gold has a relatively low melting temperature, it is sometimes carried by these hydrothermal solutions through the fissures in the rock and solidifies inside the quartz veins.  Thus, the place to look for gold is usually in quartz veins near the intrusion of a magma body. The city of Rossland is situated in the heart of an ancient volcano. This volcano is the reason why Rossland is so full of gold. If these quartz veins are eroded by the earths cycles, the gold may be found in streams and rivers; this explains why prospectors were able to pan for gold. Try your luck at panning for gold after the tour!\u000a\u000aTo get credit for this cache you must do three things:\u000a1. Take a picture of you or your GPS at the Leroi Gold Mine sign or somewhere on the property. If  you take the tour please include a picture of you underground. \u000a2. Answer these questions, how many flag poles are there in a row? Please email me your answer.\u000a3. How much ore was taken out of the mines in Rossland and how much was it worth? (Read signs)

V<p>Peterson Creek winds it's way down from the highlands, and has\u000acarved deep gullies through it's journey to the Thompson River.</p>\u000a<p>The geography of this City Park is beautiful and one of the best\u000aways to appreciate this beauty is to follow the creek bed. As a kid\u000agrowing up in this area, I hiked from the top Bridal Veil Falls to\u000athe reservoir and the Upper Falls and back down many times... this\u000ais a challenging venture that requires some scrambling and route\u000afinding. The really beautiful parts of the creek are only\u000aaccessible this way. Boots are recommended simply because sometimes\u000athe only way to move ahead is through the creek.</p>\u000a<p>There are 2 recommended entrances... the upper Summit Entrance,\u000aand the Whiteshield entrance. From each one, make your way down to\u000athe creek, and head south along the creek bed. If the Summit\u000aEntrance is taken, 2 choices can be made... walking along the\u000atrails to the reservoir, and then following the creek down (N), or\u000awalking away from the cache, taking the trail down to the creek and\u000athen following the creek up (S). Either way, cachers are\u000a<b>STRONGLY DISCOURAGED</b> from going straight down to the cache\u000afrom the trail.</p>\u000a<p>There are cliff bands above the cache, and the bank erodes\u000aeasily. A misstep is extremely likely, and I would hate to see\u000asomeone hurt. I walk the upper trail quite a bit, if I see signs of\u000acachers coming in from the top, I will pull the cache in the\u000ainterest of safety. Beware of Ticks in season(Spring), and Bears in\u000aseason(Fall). Last fall I ran into a Mama and 2 cubs down on the\u000acreek... neat experience, but a little too close. There are thorny\u000athings down there, and I have seen Poison Ivy in the park, but none\u000adown by the creek. Watch for falling rock from above.</p>\u000a<p>After all of the above warnings, I know that some of your are\u000asalivating to go (I know I would be). Enjoy your hike along the\u000acreek bed. Be careful, wear good boots and go with someone\u000aelse.</p>\u000a<center>TO<br />\u000a<a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/index.php?name=Blitz&amp;op=vote&amp;gcid=GC1QA8C">\u000a<img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/pics/vote7.jpg" /></a></center>

VI was traveling back from Kelowna with a group of Scouters and said that I always thought this rest area should have a cache. And so the idea was born. We had a cache box in the car that need a place to be put. It is a great area. When the kids were little we stopped here often for a run through the trees. \u000aThe cache is a small camo lock 'n lock with all sorts of odds and sods in it. Everyone contributed something.

VJust a small cache to commemorate our daughter's first birthday.\u000aIt's been a fun year learning about being a parent. For those of\u000ayou with kids, you'll know of what we speak. For those of you\u000awithout kids, we're sure you can appreciate the changes offspring\u000abring.

And of course some trade items.\u000a\u000a<p>The cache is located just past the 1 km marker along the Malde\u000aCreek forest service road. There are a few options for parking near\u000athe cache, mainly on the wide switchback sections of the road. At\u000athe time of placing, the road was rough, but easily passable in a\u000ahigher clearance 2wd vehicle. If you would like instructions on how\u000abest to drive to this location, please e-mail me, I'd be glad to\u000aassist.</p>\u000a<p>Once near the cache, look for easy ways to access it.

VThe most noticeable thing about Greenwood as you drive into town is the Huge Slag Pile and imposing Smokestack.  The smelter was built by the British Columbia Copper Company, a New York-based organization that bought the Mother Lode mine in 1898.  The smelter was erected on a 28-hectare site at the mouth of Copper Creek (now called Mother Lode Creek) in the town of Anaconda, just south of Greenwood.  The smokestack itself towers in at 36m (121ft) high.\u000a\u000aFebruary 18, 1901 marked the blowing in of the first furnace.  The smelter was open 24 hours a day and employing 47 men during the first year.  That year 106000 tonnes of ore was smelted.  On January 18, 1902 a record amount , 416 tonnes, (about 9 tonnes for every man employed, were smelted.  the smelter operated very successfully until 1912 when shortages of ore began to affect production.  Throughout World War l the smelter worked intermittently at a reduced rate and on November 26, 1918 closed forever.  the plant was sold to Leon Lotzkar who disposed of the machinery and later gave the site to the City of Greenwood as a park.\u000a\u000aThe smelter was originally built with a sheet steel smokestack that was replaced by the present brick stack when the works were expanded in 1904.\u000a\u000aTurn off the highway at the ice cream shop (Washington St) and go over the small bridge.  The street sign for Smelter (rd?) is now missing, but the pole is still quite visible. The road is in pretty good shape, and can be done in most any vehicle. Or you can just park at the crossroad and walk up; it's not very far.\u000a\u000aIf you decide to walk down the hill there are significant ruins still in place, but use caution, as there are open holes and many of the tunnels are half collapsed. I wouldn't recommend entering any tunnels.

VThis multi-cache traces the Centennial Trail from its trailhead in\u000aRossland to Red Resort (almost). The trail is 2.7 km long\u000a(one-way). Either you'll have to have a car at both ends or walk\u000aback - I suggest the walk. [An alternate route back to the\u000atrailhead will take you past\u000a<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=56223028-145a-454f-85a0-6020165929be">\u000aScary Larry's</a>] The trail is wide, mostly level, and very\u000awell-travelled.<br />\u000aEach stage of this cache is only a few metres off-trail.<br />\u000a <br />\u000aThis cache was placed in the winter. Snowshoes will get you<br />\u000aright to each cache. If you're on skis or walking in boots you\u000amay<br />\u000ahave more fun with the off-trail part, either due to sinking\u000ainto<br />\u000athe snow or difficulty maneuvering around trees. Regardless of\u000ahow<br />\u000ayou travel, the caches are fully accessible in winter.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<p>There is some tree-cover at all cache locations, but\u000areception<br />\u000awas not bad when I was hiding these caches.</p>\u000aAll 3 stages of this cache are hidden in the same manner, so\u000aonce<br />\u000ayou find the first one you'll know what you`re looking for.\u000aThey're<br />\u000aall camo-d the lazy man's way - camo tape.<br />\u000a<p>The first 2 stages of this cache are quite small.

V<font face="comic sans ms" color="green" size="4">Humphrey and the\u000aDumptrucks</font> were a country-folk band active from 1967-1981.\u000aIt was originally organized in Saskatoon by Gary "Humphrey\u000aDumptruck" Walsh (banjo, dobro) as a jugband. By 1969 they were a\u000afiull-time professional band, playing across Western Canada, on\u000aCBC, at festivals, and at schools and universities. At one point\u000athey collaborated with a playwright to produce a country musical\u000acalled Cruel Tears, roughly based on Othello. It toured Canada and\u000aplayed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Six albums still are\u000aavailable, though mostly through special orders. Selections from\u000aCruel Tears can be heard on\u000ahttp://library2.usask.ca/90th/1970/1976.html.<br />\u000a<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/6e37418f-6458-42b5-abba-130a34774b40.jpg" />

VRobbins Range School was begun in 1915 and was opened in 1916 with\u000aMiss Helen Harrold as the first teacher. The school also served as\u000aa community center for church services, picnics, dances, for\u000adecades, Christmas concerts, and special celebrations. After WWII,\u000athe school population dwindled until it finally closed in 1952.\u000a<br />\u000aThe school building was dismantled and reconstructed onto the\u000aPineridge School site during the summer of 1985, using a grant from\u000aCanada Works, and support from the Phi Delta Kappa organization and\u000aSchool District #24 (now #73).<br />\u000aIt was officially opened on May Day commemorating 100 years of\u000apublic schooling in Kamloops. <br />\u000aThe school is opened up for a few months each spring for classroom\u000avisits and a day of heritage. This may not be a suitable cache for\u000aregular school hours. Please attempt this cache after 4:00 or\u000aduring weekends. The cache was originally placed right at the\u000aschool, but was moved to a spot withing easy walking distance, and\u000aoff school property. Although it is listed as a traditional cache,\u000ait will feel more like a puzzle cache now. \u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Count the number of shuttered windows in the school(A).</li>\u000a<li>Count the number of doors(B)</li>\u000a<li>Count the number of outhouses (C)</li>\u000a<li>The final hide is at N50 39.44B, W120 21.(A-1)9(Cx2)</li></ul>

Originally called the "Dublin Gulch" in the\u000avery early days, it eventually became known as "The Gulch" as it\u000afilled up with Italians who chose not to live on the original Trail\u000atown site. The Gulch starts as throat of Trail Creek narrows\u000abetween the high, sandy slope of Smelter Hill on its left bank and\u000athe West Trail bank where early pioneer houses were built by\u000aimmigrants as the purchased properties along the west bank steep\u000aterrain.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aYou are looking for something quite small.

VThis cache is in a fairly easy to get to location along the top entrances to Peterson Creek Park. \u000a\u000aThe area used to have a number of pine trees but they are now mostly dead due to pine beetles. Many of the trees have now been cut down and there are signs of burning all around from work crews geting rid of the dead wood.\u000a\u000aThe cache is about 20 meters off the trail and should be accessible by most children and dogs. The container is a small lock n lock with a few trade items, including a Darth Vader Pez dispenser!

VAn ammo box cached adjacent to the meadow in the pass. Location was\u000achosen to allow a loop route, following trails and old roads from\u000athe access area off Lac du Bois Road, then some kind of loop to\u000aBrock Beacon and by dirt tracks to this cache, then on to Double\u000aJeopardy and back to a parking area. Because the area is open\u000agrasslands, dirt tracks can be easily seen by using Google maps and\u000amagnifying the satellite viewer. Some interesting items in the box\u000a(for trade). Please recache the box carefully for the next\u000ag'cacher.

VThis cache is hidden in near the Lac le Jeune area. The cache is\u000abig; lots of room for tradeables! It is also hidden near a bunch of\u000ayellow-bellied marmots, but please try not to disturb them. The\u000acache is not hidden in a hole so people don't disrupt their\u000aburrows. <br>\u000a<br>\u000aThe Yellow-bellied Marmot, AKA the Rock Chuck, is a ground squirrel\u000ain the marmot genus. It lives in the western United States and\u000asouthwestern Canada. It inhabits steppes, meadows, talus fields and\u000aother open habitats, sometimes on the edge of deciduous or\u000aconiferous forests, and typically above 2000 metres of elevation.\u000aYellow-bellied Marmots usually weigh between 5 and 11 pounds when\u000afully grown. They get fatter in the fall just before hibernating. A\u000amarmot's habitat is mostly grass and rocks with few trees. When a\u000amarmot sees a predator, it whistles to warn all other marmots in\u000athe area (giving it the nickname the whistle pig).<br>\u000a <br>\u000aMarmots reproduce when about 2 years old, and may live up to an age\u000aof 15 years. They reside in colonies, a group of 10-20. The marmot\u000ais an omnivore, eating grass, leaves, flowers, fruit, grasshoppers,\u000aand bird eggs.<br>\u000a<br>\u000a(Wikipedia)<br>\u000a<br>\u000aTO<br>\u000a<a href=\u000a"http://www.bcgeocaching.com/index.php?name=Blitz&amp;op=vote&amp;gcid=YOUR_GC_ID_HERE">\u000a<br>\u000a<img src=\u000a"http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/pics/vote6.jpg"><br></a>\u000a<p><br>\u000a</p>

VThis cache is on Reserve lands and I have not asked for permission\u000aand I doubt it would be given. Nevertheless, hikers have used this\u000atrail for 20 years and I have never heard of any problems. Use your\u000aown judgment;if you choose this cache, but please respect the land\u000aand go quietly. If you have any problems, contact me and I will\u000awithdraw the cache.The mountain bike and hiking community call this\u000atrail the Moonscape Trail because of its bleak, eroded terrain. Few\u000atrees, but lots of sage, bunch grass, and prickly pear cactus. A\u000alarge but remote area near the city, it gets few visitors. Access\u000afrom the east or west is possible. Use Google Earth or Google maps\u000ato see the trail which traverses the whole area and takes you close\u000ato the cache. From the west, hikers or mountain bikers can start at\u000aN 50 41.983, W 120 16.983 or a higher access can be used from the\u000atop NE end of the golf course. Either way, the fence crossing is at\u000aN 50 41.590 W 120 16.924. From there it is just a hike on pleasant\u000atrail. The target is a lock n lock box with the usual materials.\u000athis is a good trail for hikers, especially early or late in the\u000aseasons. Not a good winter cache. Good luck. \u000a<!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#669966" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/roundlogo-green5.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VShumway Lake is a long narrow alkali lake next to Highway 5A\u000abetween Kamloops and the Nicola Lake area. It certainly is not a\u000adestination in itself, but it is the home to a number of water\u000asports in the region. First commissioned for rowing, canoeing, and\u000awater skiing competition for the 1993 Canada Summer Games, it has\u000asince become the home for training and competitive paddling for\u000aflatwater sports. A 2000m race course can be seen from the highway,\u000amarked by buoys anchored below the lake. For several weekends in\u000athe summer, local, regional and provincial championships may be\u000astaged at the site. The south end of the lake is also used for\u000awater skiing competitions (jumps and slalom). <br />\u000a<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f668b8c2-8d94-48ac-88e9-5d5b75010abe.jpg" />\u000a <br />\u000a The cache is a lock and lock container, hidden well out of sight.\u000aBe discrete when the area is being used, but most of the time it is\u000aa quiet spot just off the highway.

V1st part of this cache is a micro.  Contains only the co-ordinates for the 2nd (main) cache.  Please be careful retrieving and replacing the micro as this is a very well travelled area and many potential muggles may be about.\u000a\u000a2nd part of cache is a small ammo box containing some trade items and a log book.  No need to go outside the Park boundary to find this one.  It is pretty straightforward.  The clue is for the first cache.  None should be needed for the second.\u000a\u000aYou may want to take your camera.  View from the 2nd cache vicinity is pretty good.

VCache originally was placed by Beavis and titled Duffy's Pub.  Treasure lov'n Tami took over the cache location in May 2008.  Sundemon adopted the cache in 2009.  The location is close to the original placement by Beavis. Extensive tree removal in the area prompted a slight move to a safer location.

VAshley\u2019s Riverview Micro\u000aThis micro is located along the Columbia River walkway in down town Trail. The whole loop which takes you across both bridges takes about 30 min and has beautiful views of the Columbia River. It\u2019s a very easy walk to the cache location, and you can drive almost right up to it. This is a micro cache so there is no room for trading items, just a log book and pencil. Please replace the log in the exact same spot as this is a VERY popular location for Muggles so stealth is required.

VThis is a theme cache. It's an ammo container initially placed with 7 CD's and we are asking cachers to "take a CD - leave a CD". The first 7 cd's were:\u000a- Mark Knopfler, "Sailing to Philadelphia"\u000a- Cassandra Wilson, "Belly of the Sun"\u000a- Righteous Brothers, "Unchained Melodies"\u000a- Neil Young, "Heart of Gold"\u000a- John Mayall, "The Turning Point"\u000a- Hootie & the Blowfish, "Fairweather Johnson"\u000a- and an unnamed Pearl Jam CD\u000a\u000a The cache is located in McConnel Lake Provincial Park, hence the cache name, "Music in the Park". It can be accessed via a lovely hiking trail that goes all the way around the lake.

VA persuasive letter to a \u201cpaesano\u201d in Italy about the mining areas of Butte, Montana and California and telling them of the work available in this remote little smelting town situated in the mountains of British Columbia alongside the banks of the Columbia River brought the influx of Italian immigrants to Trail.\u000aThe first to arrive were (people from the provinces of) Toscani followed by Friulani, Abruzzi, Trevisani and Calabrese and today practically every dialect is represented in this City of Italians which is a perfect example of the multiculturalism within our community.  With an ever increasing Italian population plus a language barrier and being in a distant and lonely land there was a necessity to form a Society.\u000aThis came about on April 5, 1905 when 32 founding members banded together to form the Cristoforo Colombo Lodge Mutuo Soccorso No. 1, a benevolent society, whose main purpose was to assist its members in cases of sickness or accident and to provide a decent burial for the deceased members.\u000aThe Colombo Lodge was and still is the heart of the Italian community in Trail.  Without the Society they would have been just another separated ethnic group but they are a unique, united Society with (as of 2005) 550 brothers and 470 members of the Sorelle di Colombo.\u000aThe Piazza Colombo is a tranquil little park situated in the heart of the Italian community of Trail alongside the Colombo Lodge.  It was constructed by over 50 skilled volunteers who put in more than 7500 man hours of labour constructing the park and feeding the workers.\u000aThe grotto in the southwest corner of the Piazza is actually the last remnant of the home of Issaco Georgetti, Trail\u2019s first Italian immigrant.\u000aCome and rest in this attractive little park and think back to the changes that 103 years bring.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a medium size peanut butter jar with the usual logbook and stuff, some small trade items and a small FTF.

VBon Appétit, is a recipe exchange cache.  Mrs. Ferret had this idea, and we all thought it was a keeper.  The cache is in a 6in x 8in Rubbermaid container.  We stocked the cache with 12 of our favourite recipes, on 4 x 6 cards.  There is a first to find prize, clearly marked, and a second to find prize as well. There is room for some small trade items, but the idea was to share other recipe ideas with our fellow cachers.  The growling that you hear is not the residents, it's your bellies.  Enjoy, and have fun.  Oh ya, this is a high muggle area as well. Bon Appétit

The road however is not maintained and has a lot of groves and washed out areas, there was also tree`s down in some spots from the recent stormes that are insurpassable by an type of vehicle. Please be warned if you wish to make it to the top where the flag is it is 4 hours from the parking area indicated. This time can be reduced if you can make it part way up in a vehicle. The cache has two parts, the co-ordinates above are the co-ordinates to the first cache. In the first cache are the co-odinates to the second cache. I did not place this cache at the top as I wanted it to be accesible to everyone, even those who dont intend to do the whole hike. Both caches are containers that can hold trade items the first container is a size 2 camoflaged tuperware type. The second is a comoflaged type 3. \u000a\u000aOriginal contents Include:\u000aTrade Items \u000aAn awesome FTF prize \u000alog book \u000aAnd Pencils\u000a\u000aPLEASE ENJOY YOUR HIKE AND THE AMAZING VIEWS MT.ROBERTS HAS TO OFFER.

VThere are about 50 km of trails in the Stake-Lake system and and probably as many in the adjacent Lac le Jeune area.  The area is home to cross-country skiers in the winter and in the summer mountain bikers and hikers use the area.   \u000aThe cache is at the top of a side trail called Rattler Viewpoint.  There are no rattlers in the area, but all the trails have a western theme - Bushwacker, Hold-Up, Cartwheel, Drifter, and so on.  Although this cache is fairly close to the Lac le Jeune Road, a straight route won't work because of a fence, a marsh, and a canyon.  It can be approached from either the Stake Lake parking lot (longer) or from Lac le Jeune Provincial Park.   Park near the gate, proceed north to pick up the trail system (maps are posted at every intersection) and work your way to the trail junction at N50 29.757, W120 28.700.  From there, just follow the trail to the top.  There are good views from the top - Chuwhels Mountain, Stake Lake, McConnell Hill, and the  surrounding hillsides.  There are drop-offs to the west, so be careful there.  The cliffs are actually vertical, faceted basalt columns which you can't see from the top.    There will be a future cache at a lower viewpoint next to the canyon.\u000aThe cache is a small container with room for small items (pin sized) only.

VThe cache is located in Tadanac. There is parking available by the cache site. This area once was the location of the Tadanac community hall. There are tennis courts and a few picnic tables. Across the street there once was a swimming pool and small elementary school.Old memories of which I had attended at one time. Below the cache site is the Teck-Cominco mansion that once was used by the head executive or guests. From the parking area follow your GPS. please bring your own pen or pencil because the cache is small with no room for trade items. Stealth is requied.

VThe Stake Lake area includes 45 km of ski trails built in 1986 when\u000athe Coquihalla Highway bisected the Bush Lake trail system. The\u000atrails fill the area between Lac le Jeune and McConnell Lake and a\u000anumber of trails round McConnell Hill, a volcanic butte. Three\u000acaches were placed on a circuit around the basalt columns of\u000aMcConnell Hill. A cacher can hike or bike the trails in a circle\u000aroute picking up all three caches. An Amphitheatre takes the cacher\u000ato the north flank of McConnell Hill. The easiest approach is to\u000apark at Stake Lake and use the trail maps to go to the north\u000aapproach up the Sidewinder trail. At N50 31.087, W120 27.223, look\u000afor a side trail to the right. Follow this trail to the\u000aamphitheater. <br />\u000aAfter completing this cache, follow Sidewinder to the top and go on\u000ato Bushwacker South Viewpoint.<br />

VThe items inside the cache are more kid related but not all of it is. The FTF prize IS for a kid. The cache is located at an interesting part of west trail. The best way to access the cache is to park on Milligan Ave at N49 05.707 W117 42.969. There is plenty of room for cars on that street. Once in the park area you will see a very long set of stairs that takes you down to an open field with an old water fountain directly in the middle. This site was once a wadding pool for kids but over time has just grown over. From here you should begin your search. Have fun, trade fair.

VIt\u2019s TRU, our Solar System is changing.\u000a\u000aThis is a 6 part multi cache.  A good walk with a little billy goat part at the end.  There is some road construction coming up in the spring, so hopefully Neptune and Pluto survive.  You may think this is a joke, but I cannot find Uranus.  It may be lost due to construction, but if anyone finds it, let me know and we can add it to the hike.  The first five points have clues to get you to the cache (Ammo container).  Check out the description of the planets to get the #\u2019s needed.  I know Pluto is not a planet, but you know what I mean.  A pen or pencil may help keep track of the clues.  \u000a\u000aFind Earth at 50d40.294, 120d21.836.  Check out the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars for clues.\u000aFind Jupiter at 50d40.E40, 120d21.S80       (50d40._40, 120d21._80)\u000aFind Saturn at 50d40.ES0, 120d21.9EJ       (50d40.__0, 120d21.9__)\u000aFind Neptune at 50d40.5J5, 120d22.2JT      (50d40.5_5, 120d22.2__)\u000aFind Pluto at 50d40.NV1, 120d22.EMR         (50d40.__1, 120d22.___)\u000aFind the cache at 50d40.JP3, 120d22.PE2   (50d40.__3, 120d22.__2)\u000a\u000aSun = S = # is two times how many billion years the Sun will run out of fuel.\u000aMercury = M = # is in the volume and in the 1st  paragraph.\u000aVenus = V = # is the % of light from the Sun that makes it\u2019s way to the surface.\u000aEarth = E = # is the 1st number in the write-up for Earth.\u000aMars = R = # is the decimal of hours in a day.\u000aJupiter = J = # is the hours in a day divided by 2.\u000aSaturn = T = # is the sum of all the numbers in the diameter divided by 2.\u000aNeptune = N = # is the only one in the volume that is not a zero.\u000aPluto = P = # of kilometres Proxima Centauri is from the starting point of the walk.

The first cache\u000ais a non-traditional micro in a very dark spot a few metres from\u000athe listed coordinates, but you may find that your GPS will not be\u000avery accurate in this tight location. Use the clues once you are\u000aclose and come prepared for this challenge. The second cache is a\u000asmall lock n lock container with appropriate items. Although both\u000ahides are winter friendly, the route in will be a challenge. Except\u000afor the intrepid, this is a better cache in dry conditions.

VA micro cache in Peterson Creek Park, honoring those that have given their lives protecting us.\u000a\u000aThe cairn near the Cache location was built in Memoriam to the 3 RCMP officers (all under 25) that lost their lives to George Booth, a renowned local straight shot.  This incident is still considered one of the worse tragedies in RCMP history.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a camoed film canister containing a log book and pencil. This is a busy park, with high Muggle traffic, so stealth may be required.

You'll be walking behind peoples back yards, but you won't have to walk through anyone's property and you don't have to climb any fences.\u000a\u000aThis is our second cache that we have made.

VOne of the fist caches that I did in kamloops was Al's cache. It was easy to access and find. Ever since it was muggled I  wanted to replace it with another easy to find and access cache. \u000aThis is very close to the original Al's cache. This is not a tradable cache but a log only micro so bring your own pencil/pen.

The cache site is located less than 3km\u000afrom the parking area. It's a level walk/ride to the cache area and\u000athen a short scramble up some rocks to the cache site. \u000a<p>When the water level is low (early spring, late fall), the\u000atunnel is dry and you may walk through it. Conversely - when the\u000awater level is high the tunnel may only be passed through with a\u000aboat or canoe. The tunnel may be totaly submerged during very high\u000awater, but that hasn't happened in years.

VThis cache was hidden as part of the finale to the spring cache blitz 2008, a FTF dash, which included 11 caches hidden all over Kamloops. Congrats to all the winners, and everyone who came out to make the event a success!\u000a\u000a"Mac park" is one of the key elements which makes Kamloops the tournament capital. It has 11 baseball fields and 6 soccer fields. It also has an arena, skate park, play ground, a BMX track, lawn bowling, a golf course, and tennis courts.  It also has a xeriscape garden; xeriscaping emphasizes the efficient use of the minimum amount of water required to sustain an attractive and functional landscape. There are trails through-out and all around the perimeter of the island, which is about a 3k walk, all flat and well maintained.

VThe Overlanders were gold seekers from Ontario who trekked across\u000athe western Interior to the Cariboo between 1858 and 1862. Most of\u000athem were young men of limited means who hoped to make their\u000afortunes in the Gold Rush. The largest group made the crossing in\u000a1862. Members gathered at the Red River Settlement in Manitoba, and\u000athe first group of about 150 people, led by Thomas McMicking, set\u000aout early in June. Two smaller groups followed. The main party's\u000aonly woman, Catherine Schubert, traveled with her husband and three\u000ayoung children; their fourth child was born after they arrived in\u000aBC. They journeyed by Red River cart and packhorse, crossing the\u000aplains to Fort Edmonton. Another group went overland south toward\u000aKamloops, two were drowned along the way and the rest almost\u000astarved. A few Overlanders found gold in the Cariboo; many remained\u000ain BC and went on to have successful careers. The cache starts in\u000aOverlander Park, behind Henry Grube Education Center, which was\u000aoriginally called Overlander School. There is an extensive beach\u000ahere at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers. At\u000ahigh water in June, the beach disappears, but the caches are\u000alocated above the high water mark. Overlander Bridge meets the park\u000aon the west side, close to the cache. This is high-muggle area so\u000asome cleverness may be required. Both caches will take some\u000asearching. The cache is small - logbooks and pencil only. Please\u000alogin and replace (both) with care.

VThis cache is a tour of an area of rock outcrops on the western\u000aflank of Mt. Dufferin. The most direct route is to park at N50'\u000a39.986, W120 25.146 and hike about a km into the first of 5 rock\u000astops. The final cache is a lock and lock filled with polished\u000astones, some of which are agates and opals, moonstones, chalcedony\u000aand various polished gemstones. Trades will be small polished\u000arocks, one for one. Each hide is a small cache, requiring some\u000asearching. Leave enough time to finish the tour, which amounts to\u000aabout 0.8 km once you get there. Nice views at stops 3 and 4. Bring\u000atrade items and enjoy the tour!

VIn 1888 the Guerin family mined coal off the flanks of Coal Hill\u000aand Iron Mask Hill. In the 1890's iron, copper, and gold were found\u000aand the Python group explored, laid claims, and mined the north and\u000awest slopes of the area. Adjacent to these hills, the Pothook Mine\u000a(now the Afton site) yielded copper and gold. By 1913 H. Wallender\u000aheaded a consortium that brought electricity and development to the\u000ahillside. 75 men worked at the mines, a hotel was built, a small\u000aschool, and homes were added until a disastrous fire in 1914.\u000aDevelopment slowed, but additional claims by the Python Group and\u000alater the Makaoo Group sunk shafts and hauled ore out of the\u000ahills.<br />\u000aFor 25 years, no mining has taken place, the shafts have mostly\u000abeen filled in, although evidence of excavation is everywhere on\u000athe north and western sides, and a few older homesteads remain in\u000athe area of Galaxy Lake. Only the names remain - Coal Hill,\u000aWallender Lake, Guerin Creek, Copperhead Drive, and Makaoo Lake.\u000a<br />\u000aThere are a few fences in the area now, some new and some old, some\u000aup and some down. The hike to the top can be made without crossing\u000aany fences, but it depends on the approach taken. It is a healthy\u000ahike to the top, following a variety of trails, mountain bike\u000apaths, old mining tracks, and skid roads. A microwave facility at\u000athe top warns newcomers to stay clear. The cache is an ammo box\u000aplaced with a view of the plateau grassland. \u000a<!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#669966" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/roundlogo-green5.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VCache is located at Cataraqui Park (better known as Belle Park) on Belle Island. There are 2 stages, the 1st is a micro hidden in the forest not far from the shoreline. The 2nd is a single ammo can hidden in the forest. Redirect and cache are easily accessible by walking or biking. Round trip from the parking area should be just over 3km.

VSome of my favorite caches include an enjoyable walk hopefully just like this walk along Belle Park Fairways to Cataraqui Park. Please put the cache and redirect back \u2018exactly\u2019 as you found them so that others can have the same experience.\u000a\u000aDon't be mislead by maps showing Belle Park Drive going to Belle Island. There is no vehicle access to Belle Island anytime of year. I recommend that you park at the parking lot on Montreal Street (coordinates provided) and then walk down the road (Belle Park Drive) on the south side of the golf course to Belle Island. \u000a\u000aFrom City of Kingston Parks Department: "Please be aware that public access to the golf course is for members or those who purchase green fees. There is no public access to the course for any other reason."\u000a\u000aThe cache was loosely named after its predecessor on Belle Island "Father & Son Cache #1" (GCX5H9) by rodhsterling which was hidden in July 2006 and archived in March 2008 with 56 finds.\u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!!\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to swimmrguy, Luke, ace862, skottikus and Team Spannah on their shared FTF **

VThe cache is hidden on a point with greenspace, benches, and views\u000aof the lake. A good place for kids, dogs, bikes and strollers.\u000aHowever, if coming from Lake Ontario Park, a short section of the\u000apath is gravel and steep.\u000a<p>Please do not park in the private parking lots which are closest\u000ato the cache. The best place to leave your car is Lake Ontario\u000aPark. From there, follow the path to GZ, a 7-10 minute walk.</p>\u000a<p>The cache site is exposed to the prevailing strong SW winds. On\u000awindy days you can expect the spray from waves to soak you at GZ.\u000aThe path and site are very dark at night. Terrain for most of the\u000apath leading to the cache is 1, and just a bit rougher at GZ.</p>\u000a<p>When <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMHZcgM11GU">Dave\u000aUlmer hid the very first cache</a> in May 2000, he was testing and\u000acelebrating the removal of selective availability (which increased\u000athe accuracy of GPS). But he didn't just hide a rock or a note. He\u000ahid a logbook and swag, including the now famous "can of beans". He\u000awas having some fun. That's the point, have fun geocaching!</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

VSCUTTLEHOLES - MOIRA RIVER This area is considered to be an\u000aoutstanding example of a karst development which is only uncommonly\u000afound throughout Ontario. The Moira Karst site extends from Latta\u000ain the south to Chisholm's Mill in the north. The Ontario Ministry\u000aof Natural Resources has deemed the area to be ANSI (Area of\u000aNatural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is geologically &amp;\u000aecologically sensitive. As such, please stay on the clearly marked\u000atrail &amp; respect the area immediately surrounding the cache\u000asite. Unique geological features have been created in the limestone\u000abedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range\u000afrom sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone\u000aislands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the\u000ariver actually disappear underground only to resurface further\u000adownstream. While many of the geological formations are on private\u000aproperty (such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of\u000apassageways) &amp; not available to the public, a good example of a\u000ascuttlehole can be seen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761. It is\u000aapproximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be\u000aentered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution\u000a&amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a\u000alimestone formation. It is unnecessary to enter the cave as the\u000acache is located about 40 m away. What's really strange about the\u000aarea is that during July , August &amp; into September you can walk\u000aon sections of the dry limestone riverbed. However, during the\u000aspring runoff the Moira River Canoe Club perform their annual\u000awhitewater races in the same location!! From the cave location you\u000acan see the guy wires that hold the racing gates stretched across\u000athe river. The cache is available year round but exploration of the\u000aentire area is best during the months listed above. Pictures (taken\u000aover the past 2 years) of the cave, dry riverbed &amp; whitewater\u000akayaking all taken within 100 m of the cave location are included\u000awith this listing.\u000a<p><b>Enjoy but please use caution with kids near the river during\u000athe spring runoff &amp; at other times due to several visible\u000acollapsed sinkholes and open caves.</b></p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to butterfly5 on the FTF!!</p>

VThis is the new and improved relocated-re-cached original hide of the WHISTLING SWANS WETLAND geocache. This cache had to be rewritten due to the nature of the DISTANCE that this cache has been placed so it is a REAL bonus for those who want to re-visit the site and log a new number. There is an abundance of free space here for dog walkers and for children who like to explore and climb around some neat ol dead falls. It is a free open space(donated by the pre-existing DuPont plant) seldom visited and not domesticated for visitors. An added bonus to this land space is the viewing areas it affords of the marshland. If you are lucky you might get a glimpse of the "DUCKS UNLIMITED" and enjoy the spot for a lovely quiet snack during your geocaching of the Kingston area and of the Cataraqui Creek Marshlands.\u000aAs this area is used by a number of "non-scooping" dog walkers be mindful of their refuse and walk carefully particularly along the northwest trail if you decide to follow that line.\u000aIn the Spring there is a great number of interesting waterfowl to capture with your camera and you can even access this cache if you decided to by launching a kayak from King Street and Auld Road! \u000a\u000aCongratulations on a combined FTF to bluelamb03, Remote Sensor, Mr. PackRat, mTn_biker65 and mm_dancer. Special congratulations from "The Swan" to mTn_biker65 on his 100th FTF. The wetlands is honoured by the presence of such greatness. Woo Hoo! KAG rocks!

VCache is placed to commemorate our 40th Anniversary (May 18, 1968).\u000a\u000aThere is a Martello Tower nearby (Canada's First Line of Defense against invasion - Shock &amp; Awe Eh!), a cross in honour of the Daughters of the Empire (I don't think Palamino is a member), Kingston General Hospital where Palamino was born and worked - but wait there is more. Rumour has it that during the 60's important naval exercises took place off shore here in the dark of night, now I can't confirm that and when I mentioned it to Palamino she yelled "I don't know what you are talking about". Maybe a cacher with navy experience can shed some light on this if it isn't a matter of "National Security" or perhaps "Personal Security". \u000a\u000aAnyway Palamino is a native Kingstonian, I'm an import in '61 from several places in Canada and one in Europe, we got together in '64, first date was to a KCVI dance, the rest is past, present and future. \u000aIts been a blast Palamino and hiding a cache together to commemorate it is like the "Icing on the Cake". Speaking of the cake my father made and decorated the wedding cake. Can I do that? NOT A CHANCE! \u000a\u000aCOSMIC CONNECTION: This is also our 40th hide (not planned), this is #29 for Runaway46 &amp; Palamino has 11.\u000a\u000aThe only caching we did 40 years ago was without a GPSr which made it somewhat difficult since all the caches had been hidden without a GPSr. Come to think of it we didn't find any, go figure!\u000a\u000aPlease enjoy our cache, it is not difficult as has been our custom.\u000a\u000a\u000a****Congrats to Team Jevre on a quick FTF, we are watching the action from afar in Lake Placid, NY****

VIt\u2019s hard to imagine that this tiny park situated at the end of this well established neighbourhood was once the site of a tannery.  For 40 years P.R. Lamb\u2019s Glue and Blacking Factory spewed noxious chemicals and animal waste into the now lost Lamb\u2019s creek.  These practices continued until 1888 when the underinsured building burnt to the ground, I would think, much to the relief of the nearby residents.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a screw cap container and some level of stealth is required as there are usually 1 or 2 dog walkers in the park.

V<h3>George Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium</h3>\u000a<p>The George Taylor Richardson Stadium, which is located on\u000aQueen's West Campus, is actually the second facility to bear that\u000aname. The original stadium was located where Mackintosh-Corry Hall\u000aand its parking lot now stand. It was opened in 1921, having been\u000abuilt on a piece of land bought from a community of nuns. This was\u000athe stadium where the great football teams of old played, and where\u000aFranklin Delano Roosevelt received his honourary degree from\u000aQueen's on August 18, 1938. President Roosevelt made a historical\u000aspeech here that was seen as a departure from American\u000aisolationism.</p>\u000a<p>When a new social sciences complex (Mackintosh-Corry Hall) was\u000aplanned, the original stadium was torn down and relocated to the\u000anewly acquired West Campus. Many staff, students, and alumni were\u000avery upset about the move, feeling that the stadium belonged in the\u000aheart of campus. The project went ahead, however, and featured a\u000aceremony in which a piece of sod from the old stadium was\u000atransplanted to the new one. More than thirty years later, the\u000aGeorge Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium is still a big part of\u000aUniversity life. It is named in memory of George Taylor Richardson,\u000aa Queen's graduate renowned for his athleticism and sportsmanship\u000awho died in WWI. The original stadium was funded by George's\u000abrother, James Armstrong Richardson, graduate and Chancellor of\u000aQueen's.</p>\u000a<p>This an easy micro for my first cache. As this is a micro please\u000aBYOP</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border="0"\u000awidth="163" height="163"></a></center>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>

VAs you may or may not know, I\u2019m very passionate about geocaching. I\u2019ve met a lot of exceptionally great people and had some very cool experiences. I\u2019ve seen places that I would have almost certainly never seen before and challenged myself in ways that I thought were, if not impossible, then definitely improbable. In experiencing the total geocaching experience, I\u2019ve had to travel. I\u2019ve been caching internationally as well as domestically and I\u2019ve noticed one very interesting thing, that regional cachers have a distinct identity. In Kingston it\u2019s the KAG\u2019ers, in Ottawa it\u2019s the CCC\u2019ers.\u000a Well in Brockville, we\u2019re caught between two mighty empires that both have a lot to offer, but wait, a new empire has arisen, quietly, very stealth like. It\u2019s a group of mighty geocachers called the BAGGERS (Brockville and Area Geocachers) and my friends in time, if your cache hasn\u2019t been BAG\u2019d, then it truly hasn\u2018t realized the total caching experience. However, we Baggers are a kind and compassionate people and we\u2019d like all cachers, from everywhere to come join us. We want Brockville to be a caching destination and in doing so I\u2019m starting a six cache micro series with a medium sized traditional cache final. It is my hope that in doing so people will come and see that Baggers are a cool lot and invite us to neat caching functions.\u000a\u000a The first three caches in the series (#1,2 and 3) contain the numbers to the latitudinal coordinates and the second three caches (#4, 5 and 6) contain the numbers to the longitudinal coordinates. Thus, to obtain the coordinates to the final, you have to get all six micro caches first. The caches are all magnetic key holders and are in very public, high muggle areas, so please be careful and collect the six micros with stealth. You\u2019ll have to bring a writing instrument as the caches have no room for such implements. The final is literally full of booty with a gift certificate for golf at Sunnidell Golf Course being the prize for the FTF, it also contains geocoins, travel bugs and swag a plenty at the time of placement. So please come to Brockville and enjoy the city and a day of geocaching. \u000a\u000aCheers\u000aCanadianzombie\u000a\u000a*Congrats to Geogranny and Binrat for braving a cold rainy night for the FTF\u000a\u000aEdit: Evidently I made an error in saying the first 3 caches were longitudinal coordinates, when in fact they were latitudinal and vice versa. Thanks for the assistance Wareed. It has been changed in the cache log description.

Lemoines Point Conservation\u000aArea, [http://www.cataraquiregion.on.ca/lands/lemoine.htm] ,\u000aalready a cache-rich environment, now has another to add to the\u000amix, a replacement for a similar cache close to this spot. It is\u000ahidden half way along Meadowlark Lane (see trail map photo) and\u000aabout 5m. off the trail. Meadowlark Lane is a lesser used but nicer\u000atrail which parallels the east boundary fence and joins up with the\u000amain trails at either end. At times of the year there may be poison\u000aoak/ivy and mosquitoes when off the trail.</p>\u000a<p>Please note that after a rain the trail from the south parking\u000alot will have several wet sections.</p>\u000a<p>Access to the park is free, although restricted to daylight\u000ahours. Parking is available (see parking lot photos) at either the\u000asouth lot, N44 13.212 W076 36.400, or the north lot, N44 13.940\u000aW076 36.555. Please avoid spoiler photos.</p>

VGeocaching brings you to many hidden places, that you never would\u000ahave visited, or even known existed. I have dedicated this series\u000ato the Hidden Parks of Kingston (HPOK) that seem be stuck inbetween\u000ahouses, hidden from anyone but a local.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThis letterbox is located at Pimlico Park (although google maps\u000asays the park is a street west, there are only houses there), when\u000asearching for this cache stay on the path as long as possible to\u000aavoid unnecessary bushwacking. As this cache will be released on\u000aHalloween, it has a Halloween theme. The cache is divided into two\u000asections, one contains the log book, stamp and ink pad (please do\u000anot remove any of these items) and the other side is filled with\u000aregular Halloween SWAG, please try to trade Halloween related items\u000a(but not candy).<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font size="4" color="red"><b>Congratulations to ptowferret on the\u000aFTF</b></font>

V<p>SOLVING THE PUZZLE<br />\u000aThe cache is not at the posted location. To find the cache solve\u000athis silly riddle: What is a geocacher\u2019s favourite kind of\u000anut?<br />\u000a<br />\u000aConvert only the first six letters of the nut into numbers using\u000aa=1, b=2, etc. (Use only the second digit for 2-digit\u000anumbers.)<br />\u000a<br />\u000aInsert these converted numbers into the coordinates:<br />\u000a N44 13.(1st letter)(2nd letter)(3rd letter)<br />\u000a W076 36.(4th letter)(5th letter)(6th letter)</p>\u000a<p>You can check your answers for this puzzle on\u000a<a href="http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=1fb99c8c6e43218eafeeaba37d70c32d&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433148385431&amp;name=476f204e75747321">\u000aGeochecker.com</a>.</p>\u000a<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />\u000aStay on the trail all the way to Ground Zero. At that point look\u000afor the tall bush marked with orange tape just off the trail. (see\u000aspoiler photo). The cache is behind this bush. Don't go straight\u000athough, but go around and come in from the back. The cache is a\u000acamouflaged peanut butter jar on the ground inside the framework of\u000abranches. There is no need to uncover anything. Contents and FTF\u000aprize are kid-related. Please make sure the lid is tight and put it\u000aback just as you found it.

VKensington Market is one of my favorite places in the city, especially on Pedestrian Sundays.\u000aPedestrian Sundays happen on the last Sunday of every month from May to October.\u000aThey close the neighbourhood streets to cars.\u000aMusicians and artists of every kind take over.\u000aFood is also a highlight of Pedestrian Sundays.\u000aFrom common goodies like roasted corn on the cob to exotic Tibetan Momos.\u000a\u000aSome of the best views of Kensington are located at the cache, interesting views of the city too.\u000a\u000aNow for some hints...\u000aIf you are at the cache coordinates and standing at street level, look up!\u000aChicken level(5)!\u000aIf you see eight horizontal cables you are very close!\u000a\u000aCache is a lockable plastic container with a log book and writing utensils.\u000a\u000aThere is a nice little geode for the first to find.\u000a>>>Congrats to emzernask for the FTF!\u000a\u000aGood luck!

NO NEED TO GET NEAR THE TRACKS NOR CROSSING THEM. \u000aThe marker on google map is misleading, as the cache is actually on Hay Road side, NOT NEAR THE 401 !!!\u000a\u000aPLEASE TRY TO FAIRLY TRADE GEOCOINS AND TB'S, OR BETTER: DROP AN EXTRA ONE!!! AND DON`T FORGET TO LOG THE TRACKABLE NUMBERS ASAP.\u000aIT'S ALWAYS DISAPPOINTING TO VISIT A CACHE AND FIND THAT SOME OR ALL TB'S ARE MISSING!!!\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a\u000aLA GARE DE TB DE SUMMERSTOWN STATION\u000a\u000aVoici notre quatrième cache, mais notre première en Ontario.

N'APPROCHEZ ET NE TRAVERSEZ PAS LES VOIES FERRÉES.\u000aLe marqueur sur la petite carte de Google Map porte à confusion car la cache est du côté de Hay Road, PAS DE LA 401 !!!\u000a\u000aESSAYEZ D'ÉCHANGER LES GÉOCOINS ET TB'S DE FAÇON JUSTE, OU MIEUX METTEZ-EN UN DE PLUS!!!

VLegend has it that back in  the 1840s some adventuresome folks, lured by the gold rush and the promise of a much better climate, decided that they wanted to find their fortune in sunny California. Off they started from Elgin, which is just a few kilometres east of here. They quickly discovered how difficult it was to slog through forests, climb over rocky cliffs and wade through bogs. Too bad they weren't looking for a cache - that would've kept them motivated!\u000a \u000aSince they didn't want to tell the folks back home that they didn't get anywhere close to California, they did the next best thing. They halted their travels, looked around and decided that they'd found a pretty nice place already. So they built houses and a school and CALLED it California.   However, they found absolutely no gold  and the climate...? - no improvement there! \u000a \u000aThis is a small cache with a logbook, something for the FTF and a few items to trade. This is my first cache. I hope you enjoy the peaceful setting.\u000aLink to handicaching.com: http://www.handicaching.com/show.php?waypoint=GC1GG5M

VThe TIME structure is a waterfront landmark.\u000a<p>Situated on reclaimed land (from the excavation of nearby\u000aunderground parking lots) the structure is the subject of local\u000alore and conjecture. Some believe it is built on an underground\u000ageological fault, and the two pieces measure the earth shifting.\u000aOthers thought the two pieces would TOUCH at the stroke of Y2K.\u000aCould it be the top of a secret underground vault? Maybe it's some\u000akind of solar alarm clock?</p>\u000a<p>There is street parking near GZ. But the best way to reach GZ is\u000ato follow the waterfront path. The path is kid, bike, dog,\u000arollerblade, and wheelchair friendly. On a nice day, plan to stay a\u000awhile and enjoy the incredible view of Lake Ontario. This cache is\u000avery kid and dog friendly, so long as you stay away from nearby\u000aKing street.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

They set up the board, and set it up. Jaymee, choosing\u000ato play as the dog, went first. She landed on \u201cChance\u201d and drew a\u000acard, \u201cAdvance token to the nearest Railroad and pay owner Twice\u000athe Rental to which he is otherwise entitled. If Railroad is\u000aunowned, you may buy it from the Bank.\u201d She moved her piece to\u000aPennsylvania Railroad and bought it for $200. Jon, determined to\u000acatch up, rolled and moved his car only to land on \u201cIncome Tax\u201d and\u000awas forced to pay over $200 to the bank. Jaymee\u2019s turn and her dog\u000alanded on Kentucky Avenue, which she promptly purchased for $220.\u000aJon moved his car to \u201cVermont Avenue\u201d and purchased it for $100.\u000aJaymee\u2019s dog moved, again landing on a red property; this time\u000a\u201cIndiana Avenue\u201d, which she purchases as well for $220. Jon rolled\u000aand much to his surprised, landed on \u201cNew York Avenue\u201d, which was\u000asoon his after he handed over $200. Jaymee continued her buying\u000astreak, by landing on \u201cNorth Carolina Avenue\u201d for $300. It was now\u000aJon\u2019s turn to land on \u201cChance\u201d and he drew \u201cYou have been elected\u000achairman of the board. Pay each player $50\u201d. As Jon handed Jaymee\u000a$50, he grumbled about how he did not like how the game was turning\u000aout so far. Jaymee rolled, and landed on \u201cMediterranean Avenue\u201d,\u000aand collected $200 as she pasted Go. Not one to let money burn a\u000ahole in her pocket, she quickly bought the property for $60. Jon,\u000adesperate to catch up, landed on \u201cPacific Avenue\u201d which he bought\u000afor $300 with the intention of holding on to it in order to sell it\u000aback to Jaymee at a much higher price. Jaymee moved her dog to\u000a\u201cReading Railroad\u201d, where she purchased her second railroad of the\u000agame. Jon rolled and landed on \u201cBoardwalk\u201d, which he quickly buys\u000afor $400. Jaymee moved onto \u201cChance\u201d and read aloud her card, \u201cPay\u000apoor tax of $15\u201d, which she promptly did. Jon moved and landed on\u000a\u201cMediterranean Avenue\u201d where paid Jaymee rent with some of the $200\u000ahe collected from passing Go. This luck did not last long, for just\u000athen Jaymee jumped up exclaiming \u201cI have an idea for our next\u000acache\u201d and ran out of the room, leaving the game\u000aunfinished.\u201d

VThe cache is in a pipe under Kingston. \u000a<p>This is not the kind of puzzle that uses Google, or a decoder\u000aring. There is no math. This is the kind of puzzle that you must be\u000ain the right place to solve. First find the redirect at the\u000apublished coords. You will be sent to the place (nothing hidden\u000athere) where you will solve the puzzle. When you solve the puzzle,\u000ayou will know where to find the cache. Sound confusing? It's not!\u000aIn fact, I'll just tell you exactly where the cache is\u000ahidden...it's in a pipe under Kingston...so just go get it! Give it\u000aa try, and have fun!</p>\u000a<p>Kingston has a great waterfront. The redirect is located at the\u000awater treatment plant at the end of the waterfront trail. Water is\u000adrawn from the lake into the treatment plant. From there the water\u000ais piped underground, all over the city.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is in a pipe under Kingston.</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />

Please ensure it is covered up when you replace it, as it is very colourful. \u000a\u000aThe cache now contains many military items donated from a Captain in the army...very cool stuff!! The added puzzle is to figure out what rank the epaulets indicate.\u000a\u000aCache also includes a log book and a pen and a pencil to record your visit.\u000a\u000aA good place for CITO.  The area certainly needs it after the winter.  Bring some plastic bags!\u000a\u000aHope you enjoy it.

VA nano placed as a lame tribute cache for a friend who introduced\u000ame to geocaching and who has recently walked, ridden or sailed his\u000away to a significant milestone This guy once said to me (after a\u000areally tough and 'painful' caching experience), "The way things are\u000agoing around here what I really want to do is post a cache with no\u000aco-ordinates and say, 'A nano. Hidden in Kingston. Good Luck on\u000aFTF'." I said, "Now that's an idea. But certainly Not _ _ _!" So,\u000athis is that cache...sort of. (With thanks to RWY46 &amp; PLMNO for\u000athe container - a prize from a while ago.)

VKingston Penitentiary first opened in 1835. It is a federal maximum\u000asecurity prison which houses 400 of the worst criminal offenders in\u000athe country (like Paul Bernardo). Almost half of the inmates are\u000aserving life sentences. The previous successful escape from\u000aKingston Penitentiary was in 1958.\u000a<p>On May 7, 1999, Tyrone Conn, serving a 47 year sentence for bank\u000arobbery, escaped from Kingston Penitentiary not far from this\u000acache. On the calendar in his cell he had written "Gone Fishin".\u000aBut a dummy slept in his bunk. The evening before, Conn hid in a\u000aworkshop area. Late that night, alone in the workshop, he fashioned\u000aa grappling hook (a bent piece of metal bar), rope (canvas strips\u000afrom mailbags), and an 18 foot ladder (made from dismantling a\u000awooden cabinet). He broke out of the workshop and scurried across\u000athe prison yard to the wall. He climbed his ladder, attached his\u000agrappler to the top of the 23 foot wall, and lowered himself down\u000aon the other side! As he ran along the waterfront he sprinkled\u000acayenne pepper on his trail to throw off the dogs. By the time his\u000aescape gear was noticed the next morning, he was long gone.</p>\u000a<p>Enter the municipal marina from Yonge street, or by foot/bike\u000afrom King street. Follow the dirt road south on the east side of\u000athe marina.</p>\u000a<p>Trust your GPS. Excellent sky here. If you can find exactly GZ,\u000ayou will likely be right over the cache. Accuracy of 1m is common\u000ahere. You can save yourself alot of searching this way.</p>\u000a<p>Please don't forget to take a moment and enjoy the view from GZ.\u000aThe cache is in a public park attached to the marina. It is NOT on\u000aKP property. Stay off KP property. Respect KP fences and signage.\u000aDo not use the KP parking lot.</p>\u000a<p>**CAUTION** GZ can be a good place to drop gear, keys, wallets,\u000aand valuables into the water, or between the rocks as you search.\u000aPlease be aware of this risk before searching. Consider taking the\u000acache to the nearby bench in the park to open and sign.</p>\u000a<p>**CAUTION** GZ is NOT WINTER FRIENDLY. Snow and ice at GZ will\u000amake it very hazardous. Best to wait for better weather.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to everyone who rushed out for the FTF\u000arace:<br />\u000aFTF bullockj, jevre<br />\u000a2TF umilik<br />\u000a3TF star-guy, fantabulous, hypocorism</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

VA great trail through the woods with lots to see along the way.\u000aI'll leave it to the log entries to describe what you might find. \u000a<p>Please follow the directions to the trailhead, no tresspassing\u000arequired. Turn south off highway 2 at the waypoint given (stone\u000agate topped with lions). Proceed about 400m down this paved\u000alaneway, then turn right immediately after the second stone gate,\u000afollowing the "cemetery" signs. There is a clearly marked parking\u000aarea. Follow your GPS west to the trailhead.</p>\u000a<p>Follow the main trail above the shoreline. Go past Binrat's\u000aRevenge. Go past One in a Million. Keep to the trail, and continue\u000awest further than you would expect before turning north to approach\u000aGZ. There is no need to bushwack until you are within 10m of\u000aGZ.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is about 10m north of the trail and is not on the\u000aground. It's an easy find. However, the area around GZ is a GPS\u000adead zone. From the stone bridge, take about 35 steps along the\u000apath, then make a sharp right into the bush and walk about 20 steps\u000ato the bank of the small creek. Turn around, and you should see the\u000acache. It is close to the creek, on a small tree. The cache is\u000acamo'd but not at all hidden. It is not near any fallen tree or\u000astump.</p>\u000a<p>This short hike should take about 30 minutes round trip from the\u000aparking coords. There are some steep and slippery sections which\u000amay not be suitable for small children. Dogs will love this place.\u000aBug repellent recommended.</p>\u000a<p>The trailhead is only a few kilometers east of Kingston, and\u000amakes a pleasant bike ride. There is a paved bike lane at the edge\u000aof hwy2. The trail is not entirely ridable by mountain bike, so you\u000amay want to leave your bike near the parking coords (locked of\u000acourse).</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

VThis cache is NOT located at the posted coordinates but it IS\u000alocated within Kingston. The actual cache difficulty to find the\u000acontainer is 1.5 however due to the number of puzzles to find it, I\u000ahave rated this as a 4.5.

V<b>About This Cache</b> This cache is a tribute to ePeterson's\u000aFlorida-based\u000a<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=37f3d8f3-62ba-40ac-b0ef-901807ba9c98">\u000aPuzzle Solving 101 Cache Series</a>, republished in 2009 with\u000apermission of the author on the\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com/content/view/268/86/">Kingston\u000aArea Geocachers'</a> website. This mid-term exam cache is a\u000aCanadian reward for solving the first 9 caches in the series before\u000atrying the final exam! Solving this series will definitely help you\u000abuild your puzzle-solving skills for attacking Kingston's plethora\u000aof puzzle caches. Each puzzle contains a lesson focusing on a\u000aspecific skill, examples of how to use it, and an exercise to test\u000ayour new abilities. Study the lesson, complete the exercise, and\u000ayou'll find the location of a geocache (albeit in Florida). If\u000ayou've been paying attention to the lessons in this series, you\u000ashould have no trouble passing this local mid-term exam (without\u000ahaving to travel south of the border!). Don't be afraid to try\u000aanything you've learned. You may already have completed much of the\u000awork for this cache as part of the puzzle solving tutorial posted\u000aon the Kingston Area Geocacher's website over the past year. I hope\u000ayou kept your answers!

VBeside the beautiful St. James' Cathedral, St. James' Park features one of Toronto's nicest gardens. Kept meticulously clean by the Toronto Garden Society, \u000a\u000aThe garden is always planted with fresh flowers, always immaculately cared for no matter the season. There are several benches to catch some afternoon sun, some sculptures, a fountain and a large gazebo with often holds outdoor concerts. It's a great 19th century style garden oasis, and a highly recommended photo place.\u000a\u000aInterestingly enough,  St. James\u2019 Park used to be a cemetery of early York, but even though those bodies were moved in 1850 the park is still home to the great Cholera pits of 19th century Toronto where it\u2019s estimated more than 5,000 bodies are still buried beneath the grassy slopes at its northern end.\u000a\u000aAt the centre of the park is a statue of Robert Fleming Gourlay, an early political reformer who came to York from Scotland in 1817 and believed in open protest and petitioning as legal constitutional means of achieving reform. \u000a\u000aHe was banished from York in 1819 after he stood up in Parliament and said (I paraphrase) \u201cGentlemen I ask you, before you pass this particular bill ask yourselves, is it good for the people?\u201d to which Parliament replied \u201cWhat the hell do the people have to do with it?\u201d He was rescinded in 1839, returned to Toronto in 1856, but after failing to be elected to Parliament in 1858, he went back to Scotland. \u000a\u000aHis statue erected in the summer of 2004 stands purposefully facing St James Cathedral the burial place of his non-reformist enemy, John Strachan who after his death in 1867 was interned underneath the cathedral.

VNice view from this location, better at night.\u000a\u000aThe Christie Pits neighbourhood is named after the former Christie Sand Pits, a local landmark in this area which operated until the early 1900's. Christie Street is named after William Mellis Christie, who co-founded the Christie & Brown Cookie Company in downtown Toronto in 1861. Mr. Christie makes good cookies.\u000a\u000aThe Christie Sand Pits were rich in sand, gravel and clay deposits - remnants of the last ice age. These deposits were excavated in the late 1800's and early 1900's and used in the construction of many of Toronto's early roadways and public buildings.\u000a\u000aBy 1909, the Christie Sand Pits were depleted and the city turned the former quarry into Willowvale Park. However, the Christie Pits name has endured and is used in reference to the park as well as the surrounding neighbourhood to this day.\u000a\u000aStealth is required lots of muggles.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFTF to emzernask, congrats

VThis very small cache is placed in small urban park.\u000a\u000aWas getting different GPS readings, so these are averaged out.\u000aMost other tiny caches i have seen are similar type. Some stealth is required especially putting cache back right. Seems care must be taken to make sure cache 'sticks' back where it was found.\u000a\u000aJ.B Tyrell who the park is named after, lived to nearly a hundred!\u000aHe explored and opened mines, in the Northwest Territories and was responsible for many significant dinosaur bone finds in Canada.\u000aLived the last part of his long life on Walmer Rd.\u000a\u000aYou will need to bring your own writing instrument.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFTF to Spinning Teacup, congrats

VThe Kingston Memorial Centre is one of the classic \u201cold barns\u201d of\u000ahockey. It was built in 1950 and not much has changed both inside\u000aand out since there. The Centre is home to the Kingston Sports Hall\u000aof Fame, the Fall Agricultural Fair, and of course to the OHL\u000aFrontenacs. Kingston politics would not be the same without the\u000aCentre as it seems that council spends an inordinate amount of time\u000adiscusses its fate. Come down explore the building and the grounds.\u000aJust be careful on the playing field, it is popular spot to let\u000adogs run free.

VThe cache is not at the coordinates they are for the air photo library of MTO.\u000aIn order to solve this cache you must view the historic air photos of Kingston.  You must then figure out the coordinates for the indicated spot. Google Earth is a great aid for this part. Some of these features still exist, many don't.  Finding a long time resident of Kingston would be very helpful.  The missing number is always the digit following the decimal in GPS format (degree, decimal minutes) ie. 44 25.X98 or 76 47.X31.  The latest version of Google Earth supports this format.   The picture indicates if you should use the latitude or longitude.  Most of the time both the latitude and longitude are used, this provides a little bit of a self check.\u000a\u000aThe cache is at:\u000a44 AB.CD9\u000a76 EF.GH4\u000a\u000aNo coordinate checker or check sum on this one (takes out the reverse engineering/guessing option).\u000a\u000aCongratulations Cumbrian Lass and Bluesaway on the FTF, how fitting that a Geographer would solve it.

The\u000aMoira Karst site extends from Latta in the south to Chisholm's Mill\u000ain the north.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has deemed the area to be\u000aANSI (Area of Natural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is\u000ageologically &amp; ecologically sensitive.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs such, please respect the area immediately surrounding the given\u000acoordinates.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aUnique geological features have been created in the limestone\u000abedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range\u000afrom sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone\u000aislands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the\u000ariver actually disappear underground only to resurface further\u000adownstream.<br />\u000aWhile many of the geological formations are on private property\u000a(such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of passageways) &amp;\u000anot available to the public, a good example of a scuttlehole can be\u000aseen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761.<br />\u000aIt is approximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be\u000aentered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution\u000a&amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a\u000alimestone formation.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aTo Log this Earth Cache, Please email us through geocaching.com\u000awith the following information:<br />\u000a<br />\u000a1. Email the waypoints as to where you feel a portion of the river\u000adisappears underground and resurfaces again.

I guess you could say we were hooked immediately. 70 or so caches and many hours of fun later, we decided that it was about time we gave back to the community. Soooo\u2026\u000a\u000aThis cache is a big Thank-You to all the cachers in the area who have obviously put a lot of time and effort into making their caches interesting and challenging.  [:)]\u000a\u000aThis is our first attempt at hiding a cache. We\u2019ve particularly enjoyed the puzzle caches and the urban caches, so we thought\u2026 what better place to start!\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy!\u000a\u000aTo find the co-ordinates you must solve the following puzzle which is loosely based on Quantagories. Example: \u000a"_ _ L of the A" translates to "26 Letters of the Alphabet" \u000a\u000a[;)]\u000a_ _ _ D C at which W B (at S L)\u000aW _ to _ (W a W to M a L)\u000a_ _ _ _ _ _ S in a W\u000a_ _ S M to a D of L\u000a_ E _ H F P P E\u000a_ _ D in a R A\u000a_ F O the C N\u000a_ O of _ A B\u000a_ S to the W\u000aN _ L of M\u000a_ on the F\u000aS the _ S\u000aL _ L C\u000a_ Y I\u000a\u000aN & W co-ordinates (not necessarily in that order) are:\u000azl sd.cvo & hw ru.yxq  \u000a\u000aPictures are welcome but no spoilers please.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget to check out the obvious local attractions. There is plenty of public parking around, so please avoid the private parking areas.\u000a\u000aThere is a small prize for the FTF.\u000a\u000aFTF \u2013 Skottikus (in under 3 hours) -  WTG!\u000a2TF \u2013 (Shared) mTn_biker65, TamiMaRo and Bullockj \u2013 Well done!\u000a3TF \u2013 (Shared) canadianzombie, swimmrguy, Bluesaway, Binrat and Geogranny - Kudo's on an epic search.

VThis is my very first hide and I hope to have it published on the date of my geocaching anniversary. When we were kids we would hop on our bicycles and MAKE trails to these parts of the woodland. We play hide and seek for hours and created  all kinds of neat "woodland" games. It was always referred to as "Hiawatha's Hideaway". The last couple of years the Field Naturalists have placed nest boxes for the wood ducks here. It is a great place for birders. In the late fall and early winter months this is a sheltered spot where one can often catch sight of whistling swans and the rare glimpse of Snowy Owls. In the spring and in the fall this is a wonderful sanctuary for birds and other forms of wildlife such as beavers, muskrat , raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes and deer. For those more adventuresome, AND interested in birding,you can paddle a kayak or a canoe right up to this spot in season. Take your time on this trail and enjoy the wildlife and the sounds of nature. If you are lucky you might also see the nearby Disney Red Roof Inn. Reservations are not required.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS SKOTTIKUS ON THE FTF

VCache is next to a short natural rock wall. Fight the urge when approaching GZ (-10m) to bushwack straight for the cache. For easier access it's better to follow the trail around to the south before heading to GZ.

Sometimes change is too quick and sometimes things need not to have been changed at all.  I often wonder what will be left when all the "PRIME" development land is taken. What will be left? What we do when all the stumps and forests will be gone. No more AMIATS...only guardrails and sign posts left to use. Oh my!\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS  to mTn_biKer65 and TamiMaRo FTF

VA new mall has been "birthed" in this area and I thought it a good place to bring people out to so people could take a look around at the way things are changing in the north end of town off Division Street. There is a lot of construction going on at the moment so be on the alert for crews of workers and lots of MUD at the moment. The cache is a micro sized silver container that at the time of placement had only a small log and a prize for the FTF. Please bring your own pen or pencil to log your find. It will be interesting to watch the BIRTHING of this new mall as more and more stores come to this "Outlet".\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO SKOTTIKUS on the FTF... even though bullockj might consider it a "miscarriage of geocaching justice"  to have to be in two places at one time. LOL  LOL  Thanks for the fun KAG!

VMany years ago when this retirement residence and care facility were in the initial development stages there was an announcement made by the developer and the City of Kingston for people to come and take as many trilliums as they wished. The area was carpetted with trilliums and other wildflowers in the Spring and when the facility would be built all the trilliums would have been destroyed.\u000a\u000aI can remember racing to get here, just about as fast as a geocacher would for the race for first to find...but in my case or possibly like my race for FTF in geocaching ... I was late and the trilliums were all but gone. There were hundreds and hundreds of people about that day and the good news was that thousands of trilliums were on the move to be transplanted to other parts of the City. It was for the ridges of Trilliums on this parkland that the facility bears the name: TRILLIUM RIDGE.\u000a\u000aToday as I came back to visit a dear friend who resides in Trillium Ridge I got a glimpse of this park. I had never noticed it before and it was just begging for a geocache. So...here it is.\u000a\u000aPlease do not night cache in this area as it is considered an URBAN hide and with any URBAN hide there are inherent safety risks with unknown persons lingering in the many areas of this dimly lit park. This cache is a PREFERRED DAYLIGHT cache type. \u000a\u000aThere are a few ways to find the cache's GZ and depending on which you choose you will either  keep dry or get wet.\u000a\u000aThere may be some obstacle to obtaining this cache but if I can "reach it" I believe anyone can. And if you know me...I am afraid of heights.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a small flat container capable of some coins or small tb items but not much more. \u000a\u000aThere is no "prize" here for the FTF. I believe to have the JOY of caches placed in December, those that elongate the season for hunting, walking and FUN...well that should be sufficient for all who enjoy this wonderful GAME! \u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO RUNAWAY46 ON THE FTF WOO HOO THE COUNTRY BOY MAKES THE GEOCACHING FIND A CITY SLICK-ER! WOO HOO!

VCache is not at these coordinates, but is nearby.  The coordinates lead to the plaque commemorating the memorial.  To determine the coordinates for the final cache, you will need to go review the memorial itself.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to SQU1RE and SACARAH for the FTF.\u000a\u000aOntario Police Memorial - Preserving the memory of fallen officers\u000a\u000aThe Ontario Police Memorial is dedicated to all of the brave police officers in Ontario\u2019s history who have lost their lives in the line of duty.\u000a\u000aThe memorial is made up of a bronze statue of a male and female officer standing atop a large granite pedestal. The names of fallen officers are carved into a granite wall \u2013 the Wall of Honour \u2013 that stands on each side of the pedestal.\u000a\u000aThe words, \u201cHeroes in Life, Not Death,\u201d are carved on the memorial. This is to recognize that police officers risk their lives, every day, to protect people and neighbourhoods, and deserve the respect and gratitude of the citizens they serve. The Ontario Police Memorial is in a small park at the corner of Queen\u2019s Park Crescent and Grosvenor Street in Toronto.\u000a\u000aEach anniversary, police officers, families and friends gather at the Ontario Police Memorial for the annual Ceremony of Remembrance to honour those that have paid the supreme sacrifice in the performance of their duty.\u000a\u000aToday, the names of 234 fallen officers in the province are inscribed on the Wall of Honour.\u000a\u000aGo to the listed coordinates and do two quick calculations to get the location of the final stage.\u000a\u000a1.  Take the year that Cst Timothy C. Pomeroy from Middlesex County died, divide it by 1000 and add it to the following N co-ordinate: \u000a43 37.897.\u000a\u000a2.  Take the year the Cst Herbert M. Smart from the Toronto RCMP died, divide it by 1000 and add it to the following W co-ordinate: \u000a079 21.373.

VIn March 2002, an ammo box geocache called The Fort\u000a<a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC46BE">GC46BE</a>\u000awas hidden in the woods by Xas. It was archived in August, 2006\u000aafter 183 finds. Acting on a tip, I found The Fort in March 2009. I\u000ahave rehidden this cache in the same area using its original ammo\u000abox as The Fort Returns! \u000a<p>Please use the parking coordinates. There is no access from Fort\u000aHenry. Parking is near the marina, just down the road from the\u000aplayground and splashpark.</p>\u000a<p>There are two trails which both lead to the cache...they\u000aconnect...no need to bushwack, just follow the trail. Please stick\u000ato the trail and you won't be disappointed. No bushwacking\u000arequired. The cache is an easy stroll (about 250m from parking)\u000aalong a scenic trail. However, the trail follows the top of a\u000acliff, so use caution, especially when slippery. Because of the\u000aproximity to the cliff, this cache is not recommended for small\u000akids or night caching.</p>\u000a<p>There is an alternate path easily seen heading west from the\u000aparking coordinates. This alternate path is more suitable for dogs\u000aand children, but not nearly as scenic. Both paths connect, so if\u000ayou hike in one way, consider continuing along the trail to hike\u000athe full loop (about a half km hike). No bushwacking required,\u000aplease stay on the trails.</p>\u000a<p>Nearby are two excellent playgrounds, arrowhead beach, plenty of\u000agreenspace, and a small splashpark which is open all summer (free).\u000aKids and dogs will really enjoy this area.</p>\u000a<p>I was tempted to hide the cache in one of the many dangerous\u000anooks of the cliff, but chose instead a simple hide close to the\u000atrail. Please be careful near the cliffs. Please use any available\u000acamo to rehide the cache.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a><br />\u000aCongratulations FTF - GlenburnieHawkeye</center>

VThis is a path near the Logan Temple. It has some very pretty park benches nearby that overlook both the Temple and the island. From this view, you'd almost think there was no houses down on the island. All you can see is lots of trees, especially in the spring and summer. The path is one of many that locals use for scenic hikes and walks. No need to go all the way down to the water.\u000a\u000aChanged difficulty to 3 due to difficulty of GPS's getting accurate coordinates on hillside. \u000a\u000aCongrats to dfly57 for the FTF!!

VThe red brick Gooderham Building (commonly referred to as the Flatiron Building) at 49 Wellington Street East in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is located on the eastern edge of the city's financial district (east of Yonge Street), on the north side of the Front Street (St. Lawrence) neighbourhood wedged between Front Street and Wellington Street, where they join up to form a triangular intersection. Although a prominent landmark both for its colour and shape, it is only five storeys high. It is also the first known flatiron building in a major city, completed in 1892. The English-American Building in Atlanta was completed in 1897, and the Fuller Building in New York City was completed in 1902.\u000a\u000aThe previous building was shorter but in the same shape and was called the Coffin Block. The current building was built by architect David Roberts, Jr. and originally cost $18,000 to construct for distiller George Gooderham, son of the founder William Gooderham. It was the office of the Gooderham & Worts distillery until 1952 and sold by the Gooderham Estate in 1957.\u000a\u000aIt is well-known both for its narrow wedge shape, and for the mural on its back wall, which uses a trompe l'oeil effect to not only make the wall appear to have more windows than it does, but to also give it a more mobile effect by having its edges 'fluttering' away where they are not 'tacked' down. The mural, called Trompe.d'oille, was created by renowned Canadian artist Derek Michael Besant. The mural is a picture of the Perkins Building, which is located directly across the street. Saved by David and Thomas Walsh, restoration took place in 1998 by the owners Michael and Anne Tippin. The building was declared a historic site in 1975 and is now managed and owned by Woodcliffe Corporation.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the fine architecture, there is a large patio, and a small pub in the basement. The building is open to view from Monday to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u000a\u000aShould be an easy cache, except during lunch in the summer!  Many, many, many interested muggles!

VThis is a public park that has four magnificent old willows that have stood the test of time with the winds off Lake Ontario and the many children who have climbed and used its boughs for treasures and in one particular willow, the children in my family placed seashells for wishes. This cache is not in the 'wishing tree' but is in ONE of the THREE willow trees at the waterfront where the coordinates will lead you. Your search and challenge is to figure out WHICH TREE nests the geocache.\u000aPlease note there is absolutely no need to remove any bark, or tree growth in your search. The geocache is easily accessible and to a keen eye, very visible. If you are a geocacher who cannot control their addiction and suffer from manhandling natural plants this cache is NOT FOR YOU.\u000aABSOLUTELY NO NIGHT CACHING and during the day please be careful not to arouse any suspicion or this will be muggled. You will need to bring your own pen/pencil to sign the log.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO WOVENCAMP on their FTF and a really HONOURABLE MENTION to PROCELL \u000a\u000aA VERY SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WOVENCAMP KIDS FOR THEIR  FTF-F  -FIRST TO FIND FOSSILS\u000a\u000aWOO HOO!

VThis cache will be difficult to find surreptitiously, as there are always people about.  They might not be of geocaching stock, but they will watch you and likely pilfer the cache if you are not careful.\u000a\u000aA great pub, some good restaurants and three higher end food emporiums are nearby.\u000a\u000aThe story behind the fountain is that a couple of characters in the neighbourhood, of which there are plenty, emptied a few bottles of dish soap one night into the fountain, which then, of course, erupted and covered the park and the streets with bubbles.\u000a\u000aThe cache is well concealed, but you won't be!  Remember, you are being watched........\u000a\u000aBut you will need a hint for all the interesting people about............

VCache is a micro Lock & Lock container that is easily accessible. I had a hard time getting consistent GPSr readings at GZ. This combined with the usual high muggle activity is the reason for the slightly increased difficulty rating.\u000a\u000aShoal Tower is one of Kingston's Six Martello Towers. The tower, which is located in the water, started being constructed in the winter. The base was built on the ice of Lake Ontario. When the ice melted, the base sank to the bottom of the lake. The water was then pumped out of the base and the walls were constructed. \u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!! \u000a\u000a** Congratulations to "JonAndJaymee" on the FTF **

VOur original cache that we placed had to be removed due to kids lighting fires in the woods (yikes).  This is a couple of blocks from the original hide, but should be a safer spot!  This is a rubbermaid-type container with lots of swag in it.  Included is a brand new mini radio with earphones if the FTF wants it! :)  There's also a pedometer, bracelet, Uno card game, small toys, etc.\u000a\u000a*******  CONGRATS to procell on FTF!  :-)  *******

VThis cache was placed for children, with the intent that if they did not like their happymeal toy, then they would be able to trade it with an unwrapped toy found in the cache. The toys in the cache are from all different series and are for both boys and girls. (Please however, do not take a toy and not leave one, we would like enough toys to be able to switch) This cache was placed with permision for the store manager so there should be no problems retrieving the cache. Hope you enjoy the cache!! There is a free meal coupon for the first to find prize, and some other free item coupons for the runners-up. And please be respectful and only take one coupon per cacher.

Follow the west leg of the loop north of old River Road.\u000a\u000aThe geocache is in a small, square, rubbermaid tupperware with a clear bottom and a red lid. Inside you will find a tidbit of interpretive information, a log sheet, several golf pencils,and an information sheet about Parks Canada's geocaching guidelines.\u000a\u000aThere are no trade items in the cache and we ask that none be left as they are potential animal attractants. Parks Canada also has a Leave No Trace policy which means that we ask you to leave nothing but footprints and take nothing but photos.

If you approach from Roger's side road, you\u000awill be faced with a 'No Trespassing" sign, so please do not use\u000aRoger's side road as a shortcut. \u000a<p>The trail can be a rough walk, please be prepared. Not suitable\u000afor small children. The trail is very good for mountain\u000abiking...but watch out for ruts!</p>\u000a<p>Please do not damage the cache's hiding spot. If you look\u000aclosely, there is a "door" at one end, and the cache can come out\u000aeasily. Please rehide carefully.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />

VA short walk down a public trail which goes around Old Fort Henry.\u000a200 years ago, when most travel was by water, this was a strategic\u000alocation of great importance.<br />\u000a<p>There is parking at the top of Fort Henry Hill. Free parking in\u000awinter. When the fort is open (summer months, and Oct/Nov evenings)\u000athere is a $5 parking fee. During Oct/Nov this fee is easily\u000aavoided by visiting during the day (before 6pm) or after 10pm.There\u000ais also free parking at the bottom of Fort Henry Hill near the\u000atourist information center, but it is a long uphill walk. You may\u000afind street parking near the trailhead, but check carefully for\u000asignage to avoid a costly ticket.</p>\u000a<p>Caution!!! There are moats here! Keep dogs and kids on a short\u000aleash until well away from the Fort. The signs which say "no\u000aaccess" mean that there is no entry to the fort from the trail. You\u000aare allowed down this public path, just be careful of the moats.\u000aThe trail to GZ is bike friendly. By bike you can start at the\u000atrailhead, then continue all the way around the fort to exit. This\u000ais a great cache for kids and dogs, with the exception of the\u000adanger due to moats.</p>\u000a<p>From the trailhead, step over the low chain and continue down\u000athe grassy path being careful of the moat to your left. Follow this\u000apath until you can turn down the groomed grass hill toward GZ\u000awithout bushwhacking.</p>\u000a<p>When the Fort is "closed", the grounds are usually still open to\u000athe public. If the doors near the trailhead are open, feel free to\u000awander in and explore inside the Fort on your own.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

V<strong>This cache is intended to be done at night with as many\u000apeople and as many flashlights as possible for maximum\u000aeffect.</strong><br />\u000a<br />\u000aFrom the posted coordinates if it's dark enough and with your\u000aflashlights assistance you should be able to see a white reflector\u000ajust above head height in a tree. Once you've found the reflector\u000amove forward to that location and again using your flashlight look\u000afor the next reflector and repeat the process. Don't be afraid to\u000amove around slightly if required to see the next stage as leaf and\u000atree cover can affect line of sight in some cases. I've spaced the\u000areflectors roughly 15-20m apart so if you travel much more than\u000athat without seeing the next redirect it's probably best to return\u000ato the last known reflector and search again in case you've missed\u000aone of the few turns on the route. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<strong>You're going to continue moving from reflector to reflector\u000auntil you see a tree with 3 reflectors. This is your ground zero\u000awhere the cache is located. Good luck.</strong><br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe cache route is roughly 315m from the posted coordinates and\u000awill require multiple course changes enroute to the cache. Once\u000ayou've found the cache, signed the log and made your trades there's\u000aa few options for returning safely to the posted coordinates and\u000ayour vehicle. One option is you'll notice that the white reflectors\u000ayou followed to the cache location are red reflectors on the\u000areverse side. You could take the reverse route and with your\u000aflashlights follow the red reflectors back to the posted\u000acoordinates.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFor safety do not geocache alone at night. Groups with a minimum of\u000atwo adults are recommended. No one enjoys flashlights at night like\u000akids (and I do) so I've marked the cache as kid friendly but please\u000atake care and keep an eye on the kids when walking the trails after\u000adark.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center>Happy Caching!!!</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center><strong>** Congratulations to "astar9 and Friend" on the\u000aFTF **</strong></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>\u000a<img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></center>

VStart at the trailhead and follow the path all the way to the\u000acache. A 10-15 minute walk suitable for older kids and great for\u000adogs (let them off leash if you like). This is an excellent\u000a"technical" mountain bike trail. While walking the trail, watch out\u000afor bikes coming up fast from ahead and behind. The cache is about\u000a10m north of the path.

VThis cache was placed for the KACHE 2: The Sequel - Kingston Annual Cache Hunt Event. \u000a\u000a*******May 23, 2010: New cache placed, a little smaller than the first. Only room for a few tradable items. Please make sure that the cache is covered when you leave it!*******\u000a\u000a***This cache is right on the ground so it may not be accessible when there is more than a little snow on the ground.***\u000a\u000aThis is a small Lock \u2018n Lock container filled with Halloween swag.  It was named after the seasonal Halloween \u201csuperstore\u201d that was here in the fall of 2009.  In keeping with the theme of this event, there is a sequel to this cache: The Spirit of Halloween - THE SEQUEL.  \u000a\u000aThis is an easy find, suitable for children.  There is no need to search over the fence.  This is a high muggle area, so please use stealth and carefully cover the cache back up.\u000a\u000aFTF prize will be awarded at the event.

VThe cache is approximately one meter off of the road on Gigi's property which is located on Cartwright Point.  The Point is a small piece of private land surrounded on one side by CFB Kingston and Lake Ontario on the other - sort of a rose between two thorns.  \u000a\u000aI would take heed of the speed limit while driving through base.  There\u2019s quite often a MP with radar sitting around.\u000a\u000aYou can park on Canal du Nord but \u201cNEED\u201d to be on Mallard Lane to get to the cache.  You\u2019ll be close to it when you see the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign - you won\u2019t be if you\u2019re close to the shed.  We'd also prefer that you didn't cache after 9 pm so you don't freak-out the neighbours.  \u000a\u000aSo in a nut shell;\u000aNo late night caching\u000aA meter off the road (Mallard Lane)\u000aLook for the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign and you'll be close\u000aBe gentle\u000aThink of the hint\u000a\u000aHappy caching...\u000a\u000aCongrats to Spannah & Skottikus for your FTF...

VSo a funny thing happened to me when I was out on Whiskey Island the other day (15 Dec)...\u000a\u000aWhile doing up the caches on Cedar I thought I'd replace Hamburking's lost cache on Whiskey Island. Unfortunately it was considered too close to one of the caches I was putting on Cedar...\u000a\u000aSo when I went to retrieve the cache that I had left hanging in the last bush on the western tip of the island, I stumbled across Hamburking's Risky Whiskey Business laying in some tall grass about 20 feet or so away from its original hiding spot.\u000a\u000aAfter a few emails back and forth we agreed that he should find his own cache with all of the original content.\u000a\u000aI'll say, "enjoy" but doubt that you will especially come spring, or summer and perhaps fall.\u000a\u000aThe cache is located on city property, south west of the Kingston SPCA. Prior to placing the cache I spoke with the Animal Control Officer and he had no problems with people walking around the trails south of their building because while they've been using the field for over 18 years (use the satellite view) - it doesn't belong to them. Their property stops at their driveway.  \u000a\u000aThe terrain can be anywhere from somewhat to very wet around the cache. I would definitely wear rubber boots come spring. There will be some required bushwhacking as you get close to the cache.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations Coman123 on your FTF and your new toque.

VThis cache was previously placed at Wartman House at the green birdhouse but had to be relocated due to the saturation. This morning when I went to retrieve it the poor little thing had been chewed to small bits by what I am sure were squirrels. So I camo'd the container and made a wee little camo'd tag to open the log book so it would have a better chance of survival. The container is placed at a common, very high traffic walk through so stealth is paramount. Please bring your own writing utensil and be very careful with the opening and closing of the logbook. The camo fabric is to cover the log and re-seal the cache. Please feel free to RAISE THE BAR for the hide if you feel it may be in a "compromising position.\u000aMerry Christmas and I hope you get this before the SQUIRREL CHEW-ers come back.\u000aEnjoy the number.

VWARNING: If you are in haste to snatch a cache and break limbs or damage trees this cache is NOT for you. \u000a\u000aThe cache container is attached by a bungee cord to a limb that the seeker MUST  VERY, VERY GENTLY LIFT from the height away from the big tall tree. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT REMOVE THE CONTAINER FROM THE BUNGEE CORD. DO not remove the container from the limb.\u000a\u000aNO NIGHT TIME CACHING because there will be no way in darkness to determine the NON-LIVING CACHE limb from the actual LIVING LIMBS. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not do this cache at nighttime. \u000a\u000aThis cache is hidden within the wetland conservation area land that was donated by DuPont Canada many years ago, It is very popular with dogwalkers and birders. During the change of the seasons the terrain difficulty will increase with the wetlands becoming more wet,winter time can cause slippery, icy trails and heavy snowfall combined with wicked biting north winds which can make walking much more strenuous. The winds really blow across this area in the winter so be advised to choose your visit and plan ahead.\u000aThe day I placed the cache there were families skating on the river just across from the hide, there was no wind and it was really wonderful... so please..come to enjoy the walk...and use stealth when you go for the hide because dog walkers tend to come out of nowhere and I would not wish the cache to be compromised.\u000a\u000aThe cache container is attached to a limb by a bungee cord. To retrieve the cache you will have to determine WHICH limb is the one that will BRING THE CACHE DOWN TO YOU. There is no need to climb any trees and I do not recommend it because it is a conservation area and we need the trees for the wildlife. This area is also a nesting area so please respect the area. Leave only your footprints...or a nice geotrail of confounding overtones.\u000aEnjoy the walk in and I wish all cachers a fun time with the hide.

This is typical of one who\u000ais willing to drop what she&rsquo;s doing at a moment&rsquo;s\u000anotice to make time for geocaching friends. Bluesaway has always\u000abeen a very integral member of the Kingston Area Geocachers. When\u000anot trying to steal Jax away from his owner, her smiling face can\u000abe seen in many group shots mugging it up at GZ, most often in\u000aconnection with FTFs. Since she began geocaching she has made as\u000amany friends as she has finds and considering her stats the\u000aachievement is considerable. Besides her many and varied cache\u000ahides, for which she is the proud winner of one of\u000aCacheDrone&rsquo;s first geocoins, Bluesaway can boast the singular\u000ahonour of being the very first KAG to reach, on June 14, 2008, the\u000aall-important millennium find; then she sped up the pace!<br />\u000a<center><font color="red">(Do NOT access from hwy.

If you look\u000acarefully you will see two very small streams of water emerging\u000afrom the hillside. Don't know whether it's just natural run-off or\u000asprings. You decide.

V<p>Walking along the trail it started to feel like the forest had\u000anumerous eyes that were following us along the path. The forest's\u000aeyes were a cold, pale blue and at times everywhere we looked an\u000aeye was looking directly at us.</p>\u000a<p>As we went along we came face to face with a tree with its two\u000apale eyes wide open and looking very intently at us. It seemed to\u000abe wondering what we were doing in this dark corner of its forest.\u000aSo, we thought, it would be a good idea to give this forest\u000asentinel a reason for our intrusion into its territory and decided\u000ato drop a cache nearby that it could guard for us.</p>

V<p>We headed out to look for a few caches further along this trail\u000awhen we came to a small pond. It was a pretty spot and we took some\u000apictures and stayed a few minutes to enjoy it,</p>\u000a<p>As we stood on the edge of the pond, there was suddenly a loud\u000arustling noise and the sound of wings flapping. A great blue heron\u000aflew by just a few feet in front and just above head height. It was\u000aclear that the heron hadn't come from the pond the where were\u000astanding.</p>\u000a<p>So we did some hunting around to see where the heron could have\u000acome from. We came to a few large pines where the pond turned\u000asharply to the south. From this spot we could see the lost lagoon\u000ain this distance. The lagonn hadn't been visible from the nearby\u000atrail but there it was and the wildlife clearly liked it.</p>\u000a<p>This cache, placed as part of COG Spring Fling, was put here to\u000ashow you this lagoon. You can get to the cache by only going about\u000a10m off the trail. Please try to take the shortest route to the\u000acache.</p>

V<p>The edge of the forest can often be one of the more interesting\u000aareas to search. The trees get sparser, eventually becoming just\u000asingle trees in a stand and then the open grassy areas start.</p>\u000a<p>Because they can be seen as total trees, single trees standing\u000aat the edge can be quite beautiful with their symmetry so evident.\u000aExcept, if you look very closely at some of these nearly perfect\u000a(at least from a distance) specimens, you can see that there are\u000aactually two trees here and there are two tops instead of one, like\u000atwin peaks.</p>\u000a<p>You are looking for one of these twin peaks and the challenge is\u000anot just to find the cache here but to see if you can see the\u000ashorter of the two peaks. Its actually quite hard to see.</p>

VI have been keeping an eye on the development of this "extension" to a trail system and thought when the major work was complete I would like to place a cache along its path to bring people out to view and walk and enjoy.\u000a\u000aThe cache is just off the trail in a wooded area but abuts the property of a townhouse rental area. There are SOMETIMES children playing nearby and lots of muggles to speak of. I have spoken to the renters along Portsmouth Avenue to inform them of a geocache being placed along this trail as a COURTESY to them due to the nature of a geocache hunt by people that could alarm a judicious cautious parent who has children playing in the backyards along the trail.\u000a\u000aPLEASE DO NOT NIGHT CACHE THIS CACHE and if you feel that your presence AT ANY TIME while geocaching COULD OR MIGHT BE  PERCEIVED IN ANY WAY AS A CONCERN TO PERSONS WHO LIVE ALONG THE PROPERTY BACKING ONTO THE TRAIL, DISCONTINUE YOUR SEARCH AND COME BACK AGAIN...or don't do the cache at all.\u000a\u000aAs with any geocache search, leave no footprints or signs of your visit but do sign the log for a smiley for stealth and careful caching.\u000a\u000aFTF prize is bragging rights to finding the cache and NOT being noticed by ANY person or thing along this new trail.\u000a\u000a(Note: Upper caps are used for EMPHASIS*)\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations to jack2u on FTF and Number One in Stealth and Eco-friendly walking! Cheers

Find the cache, and enjoy\u000athe sights and sounds of Kingston.\u000a<p>The cache is a small clear container, well marked as a geocache.\u000aHowever, it is well camo'd. You only need your eyes to search and\u000afind this hide. It is hidden in plain view. GZ is a very public\u000aarea with muggles all around. Once you spot the cache, grab the\u000ahandle (you'll know it when you see it) and lift straight up. Then\u000aplease walk away from GZ to open and log.</p>\u000a<p>You will also need this IMPORTANT information so that the camo\u000ais not damaged when you open the cache container: HOW TO OPEN A PB\u000aJAR - Grab the GREEN LID firmly with one hand, and twist the clear\u000abody of the jar with the other. Please do not twist the camo. Allow\u000afuture cachers to enjoy this hide by handling the container and\u000acamo carefully. To return the cache, please be sure to allign it so\u000athat it rests fully in it's hiding spot.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

VAn easy cache north of downtown Kingston. This is the first geocache we have hidden, so we have placed it in a spot that is easy for us to keep an eye on... at our house. Our 3 year old son has just started geocaching and would love to keep track of a 'treasure' at his very own home. We have named the cache in honour of the bugs which frequent the site of our cache.\u000a\u000aFeel free to have a seat on the step while you look for our cache. This is a medium sized tupperware container suitable for small 'treasures', geocoins, etc. \u000a\u000aFeel free to snap a picture with the cache and post it online, our son would love to see that people are actually finding his treasure!
