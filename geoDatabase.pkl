VThis cache puts the "I" back in team. It can be reached by foot from the bottom or by some form of floatation device from above.  To reach it by foot, start from the park at the mouth of logan canyon and head up the trail on the north side of the highway until you find water and follow your gps from there.  On a hot summer day try this variation.  Drive up logan canyon a few miles until you see a dirt "pull off" on the north side of the road that has a small culvert emerging from under it.  Start there and float until your gps tells you you have passed it.  It is a small hike from there.  I believe you can hike from the pull off as well but I have never done it.  This water is very cold so if you plan to float or walk in the water, come prepared. Don't be afraid to move a few rocks as it is not in plain sight.  The original items include log book, several millenium edition tyconderoga pencils, a sound track from the award winning 1986 inspirational series Free to Choose, polished pink rock, some foreign coins, and an army man for good measure.

VAs stated above this cache is a difficult one in late fall,winter and spring.  If you are looking for a challenge in the winter grab some cramp-ons and give it a shot, the area in which it is placed is not far from the road.  The elevation change from the road to the cache is about 250-200 ft, the snow will more than likely be deep and slippery in this area.  The cache is located on the edge of a cliff-like drop off.  A stone pillar has been placed to make finding it easier in the snow cover.  Give it a shot, but be carefull!!!\u000a\u000a    Summer cachers:  This cache is in a steep area, but much much easier when the ground is not slippery....\u000a\u000aPark at the enterence to the Stokes Outdoor center trail.\u000a\u000a

In\u000a   winter you can at least read the historic marker to learn about\u000a   a significant first in Utah history.</p>\u000a<p>Built in the late 1800s, the neighboring electric power plant\u000awas one of the first direct current plants in Utah (if not the\u000afirst).

VPlease be discreet and re-hide well as this is a popular hiking & Mountain Biking area and the original cache was lost. \u000a\u000a    For those out of towners and those unfamiliar with the area, the trail head for Peterson Creek Park is at N50 39.875 W120 19.771. This should eliminate the need to cross under the bridge as some have previously done making this more difficult then it was meant to be.\u000a\u000a    This cache is a rubbermaid container and is located within a few meters of a well worn path, so no need to stray from the designated trails and lessens the impact enviromentally on the area. Original contents:Reindeer pin, Wooden Soldier, Old collectors milk lid, Scooby Doo II pin, Crayola coloring book, Candy cane straw, Disney post cards, Canada Hacky Sac, Teddy Bear, Canada Flag Patch, Kids rain Pancho, Ty Bumble Bee, Elephant Key Chain and Spiderman mini comic book.\u000aPlaced "Oreo has the Travel Bug" TB

In 1935 Alexander Zukerberg\u000abuilt his unique Russian Orthodox Chaple - which still stands and\u000aduring the summer months you can visit the inside of this unusual\u000abuilding. The cache is in a small white tobacco container. It is\u000afairly full so be sure that your trade items are small. The\u000aoriginal contents included Plantman's Travlin' Rock #3, 'Little\u000aKoot' travel bug, as well as several trade items and the usual\u000apencil and log book.

VA Ladies' Auxiliary to the Great War Veterans Association was started in 1919 to aid the club and to choose a memorial to war veterans. It took them years of bazaars and other various fund-raising efforts to be able to pay for it, including the clock which they ordered from England and cost $1,063. The city council stepped up and contibuted a large amount of the remaining fees, with the total cost of the construction being $5000. The Memorial was duly finished and the unveiling took place on May 24, 1925

In fact, you have to watch your feet when walking on the trail closest to the road in from the Alleyne camp area to the Kentucky camp area as you might step on one of the tiny creatures.

It is approximately 3 kilometers from the campground. You will find the cache just off the side of the trail - no more then twenty feet.\u000a\u000aThe cache has been placed in a medium sized rubbermaid container that should remain dry through all seasons. When initially place the cache contained 3 snap on key rings, bottle holder, BCAS pen, package of stickers, candle, 2 pens, canadian flag, and 2 pins.\u000a\u000aGood luck and enjoy!!

On a sunny weekend day as many as 15 people may "crowd" this trail.\u000a\u000aThe cache is hidden in a 15 cm wide rock crevice.  It is a translucent tupperware type plastic box with a blue lid in a large ziplock bag.  Although it is classed as a small traditional cache there is nothing in it except a logbook and a pencil.\u000a\u000aThere is a former weather station on the peak which is open for shelter.  \u000a\u000aCheck out the gravestone poetry which is 24 M.

The trail to the falls itself is quite\u000aeasy (I'd only rate it a 2), however the final descent down to the\u000acache can be quite difficult depending on your route. The easiest\u000away to approach this cache is from the falls viewpoint to the west\u000aof the cache. Expect large boulders and a modestly steep slope.\u000aProper footwear should be worn.

VChristina Lake is located along the Crowsnest Highway in the south-central area of British Columbia known as Boundary Country, which separates the Okanagan region from the West Kootenays. It is located 23 kilometers east of Grand Forks, just 1 km north of the United States border. The lake is renowned as the "warmest tree-lined lake in Canada".\u000a\u000aChristina Lake is home to approximately 1456 permanent residents in the winter and thousands more in the summer months. The lake is long and more then 180 meters deep in some sections. The warm water temperatures can be attributed to the fact that a sizeable fault runs through the middle of the lake which supplies constant geothermal heat, which can push the tempature up to the 23°C range in the summer.\u000a\u000a\u000ato log this cache please email the cache owner the answers to the following questions do not post in your log.\u000a\u000a1) Please Estimate the width of the lake from this viewpoint\u000a\u000aPlease post a picture of you or your GPS with the lake in the background from the viewpoint..

VThis should be a quick cache find away from the eyes of stopping muggles.  The passing muggles shouldn't be a problem.  \u000a\u000aThere are many picnic tables here and some have views of the West Kettle River. There is also river access for canoists.  Across the river is the West Kettle Valley Trans Canada Trail (TCT) which is a popular cycling trail.  The road to Conkle Lake Provincial Campground is not far from here as well.  (If you turn off on this road and cross the bridge you should be able to access the West Kettle Valley TCT off the Blythe Rhone Road. Of interest:  Paul Lautard's War Memorial in Rhone has become a rest stop for cyclists. Paul has built a beautiful shelter with hammock inside, an out house and picnic table on the site and a bicycle railing for leaning heavily ladened pannier bicycles against.)

VThis is a two-stage cache.  You access the general area via the Rosehill Road.  If you wish, you can park at N 50 39.658, W 120 18.015, but please don't block the gate.  It must be left accessible to natural gas crews.  There are also places to park beside the road about 75 m down the road from the gate.\u000a\u000aShould you prefer, you can also access the area from the Juniper Ridge side.  Thanks to the ongoing housing development, the walking distances are now about the same.\u000a\u000aThe cache itself is a 1 litre lock n' lock.  When hidden it contained:\u000a\u000aplastic pig\u000acalculator w/ pen in folding case\u000akeychain light\u000aCanada key ring\u000asmall, 3-cornered file\u000azodiac key chain\u000alogbook and pen\u000a\u000aThe first stage has a simple clue that needs decoding.  It provides the co-ordinates to the cache itself.  There is a decent view of the city along the way.  You may wish to take a camera.\u000a\u000aNOTE:  I had some problem getting a stable, accurate lock on the co-ordinates for the first stage.  Even after several attempts, they seemed to keep changing by about 10 m or so. For that reason I'm posting a somewhat more obvious clue to its location than I otherwise would.\u000a\u000aHappy hunting.

VAs this cache is located in a Provincial park, it is a theme cache .... stuff you need to go camping. The container is an ammo box. When placed, it contained a mosquito coil, flashlight, combination compass/thermometer/whistle, tick remover, 2 light sticks and a candle. The cache is located on a side trail about 100 m off of the Gus Johnson Trail, which is a circle hiking or mountain biking route around Lac le Jeune. The Gus Johnson Trail trail can be accessed from either the campground or the end of Lookout Road.

VWe discovered this wonderful vista on our way back from the Skmana Lake cache and I insisted we stop and place a cache.  Was also surprised to discover a creek and small waterfall about 10-15m away.  You'll hear it!  The cache is a peanut butter jar holding our brand new signature item (pen), horse magnet, shark keychain LED light, tape measure keychain, polished stone, two-for-one coupons, and other small items, along with the log book, two pencils, and the geocaching note.  The FTF prize is a scratch & win ticket.  PLEASE COVER CACHE AFTER REPLACING TO KEEP IT OUT OF SIGHT OF MUGGLES!  DON'T OVER DO IT THOUGH AS THAT SOMETIMES DRAWS MORE ATTENTION.  THANKS.\u000a\u000aOnce turning off the Trans Canada Highway into Chase, find the bridge that crosses the South Thompson River at N50 49.579  W119 41.893, and once across it turn immediately to the left.  Drive about 4.3 km to Loakin Bear Road and turn right on it.  Watch for the osprey nests around this area!  The cache is located about 1km further up the road at a switchback corner where you can park.\u000a\u000aAbout 3km further up the road, but turning left on the Niskonlith Lake Road, is the Niskonlith Lake Provincial Park which has 30 rustic campsites on the eastern shores of the lake. If you stay on Loakin Bear Road you'll come across Skmana Lakes Rec Site and a cache.  Continuing on you'll come to Roderick Haig Provincial Park between Shuswap Lake and Adams Lake.  There you'll find another 3 caches, two of them at the log fume trails. It makes for a great day outing!  You can go back to the Trans Canada highway through Squilax.

VCache is a plastic lock-n-lock container located near a viewpoint on a popular hiking/mountain biking trail in Kenna Cartwright Park in Kamloops, BC. When placed, it contained a mini address book, yo-yo, lucky Canada penny key chain, deck of cards, 2 mini hot wheels cars, Smokey the Bear shoulder patch, two TNRD pins and a Lisa Simpson doll. There are two access points to the park trails ... the Home Depot parking lot and the upper Hillside Ave. park entrance. From either entrance, its about a 1 hr hike to the cache.

VThis is Falkland\u2019s 2nd cache, a "CANADA" themed cache in a regular container within a container, located just off of Falkland Road, less than 1 km from Highway 97. Falkland is a rural community of about 600 residents, situated along Highway 97, between Vernon and Kamloops, 26 miles (42 km) from Vernon in the east and  45 miles (72 km) from Kamloops in the west.

VFalkland epitomizes the spirit of Canadian unity with the massive Canadian flag on the mountainside overlooking the town, made from sheets of painted plywood, and considered by many to be the largest Canadian flag in the nation.  The cache/parking location should give you a pretty good view of this hillside flag.  As you have to park on the side of the road, please exercise care by not parking too close to the blind corner and keeping well to the side.  \u000a\u000aPlease be careful removing/replacing the cache container from its hiding spot to prevent damage to the outer container.  Cache contents include log book, pencil, geocache info page, and numerous items with a Canadian theme:  pins, magnets, clip, keychains,  moose, balloon, pen, and ???  Using your imagination, it should be easy to stay with this theme!  (eg. items with flags/maple leafs or CANADA printed on them, Canadian stamps, Canadian money, Canadian animals etc.).  There\u2019s a FTF, 2TF & 3TF prize.  (3TF cacher please remove the plastic bag holding your prize)  The skeeters were out in droves when the cache was placed so recommend not wearing sandals and wearing long pants!\u000a\u000aAnnual events in Falkland include the Torch Light Parade every July 1, Daisy Days in August, the Falkland International Dog Sled Races, a two-day event on the second weekend in January, and the Falkland Stampede on the May long weekend, which offers 3 days of rodeo action, a parade and dances. \u000a\u000aWith so many small lakes in the area, there is no shortage of recreation sites for fishing, camping and picnicking. Established recreation sites surrounding Falkland include those at Joyce Lake, Pillar Lake, Chase Creek, Charcoal Creek, Bolean Lake, Spa Lake, Arthur Lake, Spanish Lake, Square Lake, and Pinaus Lake. \u000a\u000aAnd of course no trip to Falkland is complete without stopping at Pillar Lake. Geocachers, hikers, rockhounds, photographers and nature lovers will enjoy The Pillar, a 90-foot unique geological conglomerate of dirt and rock that can be reached via a short hike. A giant bony finger, the Falkland hoodoo, points skyward, balancing a precariously perched eight-tonne boulder on its tip.  Check out GCVHZ8 Hearthbreak Hoodoo, 11 km north on the Chase-Falkland Road.\u000a\u000aLittle story that I thought you'd like:  Our granddaughter, Rugrat #3 who is 3 yrs. old, loves to sing "Oh Canada" and is always singing it, while she plays or even sitting in the loo.  You'd laugh if you heard her version.  "Oh Canada . . . we pay for love!"

VThere are a couple of ways to get to this cache. When I placed the cache I started from the Lac Le Jeune side up the road past the campground. From the Fred Lake/Ross Moore lake road at waypoint 50 29.387 120 27.950 (trail location marker 32) I mountain biked up the "rustler" trail toward trail location marker 29. At waypoint 50 29.678 122 27.886 (before you reach marker 29) there is a side trail leading around the ridge. Follow this trail about 150 meters\u000ato 50 29.613 120 27.799 where you will find a trail that starts up the hill. Look for yellow flagging tape! The trail starts a little overgrown but becomes a well defined animal trail to the top of the hill. The trail is steep at\u000athis point. At 50 29.682 120 27.715 look for a trail on the right - and yellow or pink flagging tape. You should come out at the top at 50 29.642 120 27.661\u000aI suggest you mark waypoints along the way.\u000a\u000aYou can also come from the old dump/burn site - a 4x4 trail starts at 50 29.372 120 27.564.  It starts easy but gets narrow, rocky and steep.  This trail meets the X-Country ski trail.\u000a\u000aFor a longer (~4.5 km)\u000abut more defined and better trails start at the Stake Lake cross\u000acountry ski club and follow the trails to the lookout hut. See this\u000asite:\u000ahttp://www.overlanderskiclub.com/SiteCM/i/upload/7EDD3129BDBAF2D4636B6414DCD2569B5F9B138D.jpg\u000a\u000aThe cache is an ammo can with a few trade items. The real reward is\u000athe view.  If you find an\u000aalternate route to the lookout hut please email me the details.\u000aEnjoy the workout!

I also put in the Travel Bug that wants to get more of these types of caches going.  It will be necessary to use stealth due to muggles very often.  That will be the cacher's biggest problem.

VI have wanted to do a night cache near Kamloops since doing Vstarman's "Midnight Madness" in Penticton.  Now I have finaly got to it.  I hope you enjoy it.\u000aThe posted coordinates will get you to a parking place.  Shine your flashlight around until you locate a silver reflector on a tree.  From this first reflector, you should be able to locate the next reflector and so on until you find the cache.  \u000aNOTE:  There are several false trails with false caches at the end of them.  The false caches contain a note to chastise you and get you back on the correct track.  There are RED reflectors at the cache location.  The cache is located within 1 meter of the red reflectors.\u000aWhen the cache was placed, it had the ususal log book, pencil, sharpener, and a bunch of neat trade items.

VIt was brought to our attention that a Geo-Post Office was need in\u000athe West Kootenays so we were happy to help with the "Geo Pony\u000aExpress" \u000a<p>Here is how it works: Caches are placed to hold postcards. Each\u000apostcard will have a short message and a forwarding address on it.\u000aThe address will contain the person's name that you are trying to\u000asend the postcard to, their home city, and a destination cache. The\u000aidea is to move postcards between Geo-Post Offices until they reach\u000atheir destination. When you move a postcard or message from one\u000aplace to another, let the person who it's being sent to know where\u000ayou moved it to, because they might be near enough to go and pick\u000ait up. If you move a postcard from one Geo-Post Office to another,\u000aplease move it closer to the city or cache!</p>\u000a<p>You can send any message you want to anyone you want! How do you\u000aget started? Easy! Just write up your postcard and drop it in the\u000aGeo-Post Office! If there are any postcards in the cache when you\u000aarrive, feel free to forward them on if you can. If not, don't\u000aworry, just leave them for the next cacher. The cache is a small\u000alock n' lock. There is no swag in the cache, it is for postcards\u000aand trackables only. Please don't feel that you have to run out and\u000aspend your hard-earned cash on a postcard at the store. You can\u000aprint and laminate a huge variety of postcards off the\u000ainternet.</p>\u000a<p>Located at the Park N' Ride at the junction of Highway 3A and\u000aHighway 6. You will see a trail leading from the parking\u000aarea....just follow your GPS.</p>\u000a<font color="blue">For a list of other Geo Post Offices: <a rel=\u000a"nofollow" href=\u000a"http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=2d076c25-a072-4d39-a7f2-0e9e11f3b81a">\u000aVisit Link</a></font>

VThis medium cache, hidden in a black tobacco container, is about\u000a3-4m off a path at a rest stop at Chase. After finding the cache,\u000abe sure to continue on the path about 40m to see the waterfall. \u000a<p>The cache is now rehid in a new location as of June 26, 2009,\u000abut I'm not sure if your GPS will now be able to help you find it\u000aas the satellite coverage is very erratic in this area because of\u000athe nearby cliff. The previous cache hide needed explicit\u000ainstructions in order to find it as the coordinates were so bouncy\u000aand one would get "no satellite coverage" constantly. This time\u000aaround at this new location, I was able to get readings without\u000alosing satellite coverage, although the coords were very bouncy. So\u000ainstead of giving you explicit instructions, I'm going to only give\u000ayou mini instructions and a good hint if you need it.</p>\u000a<p>As I had to make my own hidey-hole for the cache, you might see\u000athe cache hide from the path, but <b>please DON'T TOUCH what I put\u000athere to hide it from muggles passing by! You need to check out the\u000aback!</b></p>\u000a<p>Remember that the cache is a black-taped tobacco can, and <b>not\u000aa large blue rubbermaid container</b>. Not sure why, but there have\u000abeen two other caches hidden nearby which have confused cachers\u000atrying to find this one-and-only published cache. I've checked the\u000aletterboxing site and there is no cache published there, so it\u000aremains a mystery. <!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a</p>\u000a<table width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#0099FF" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/bcga_logo_icon.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VThis medium sized cache, just off a trail starting in the Chase\u000aRotary Club Centennial Children\u2019s Playground Park off Pine Street,\u000ais placed in one of the 12 hiding spots that were used at the\u000aLockwood family reunion in August 2006. The cache contains the\u000ausual geocache info sheet, loot, a pencil/eraser, pencil sharpener\u000aand a FTF pin. \u000a<p>The Lockwood family has many geocachers amongst them so one of\u000athe activities at the family reunion was a geocache event where\u000aabout six legit geocache teams took part leading the 3 family teams\u000aon a hunt for Groundhog\u2019s caches. It seemed a shame not to replace\u000aat least some of the caches, so this is the 1st one \u201crevived\u201d \u2013 the\u000aoriginal name being \u201cLockwood\u2019s Pirate Stash\u201d. Those cachers who\u000adid find it can log this on as a find if they wish, after the FTF\u000acacher finds it. Our family, the Lockwood Gang: Pappy90, Dyelo\u000a&amp; Blue Heron, Mikdeni, BCArcher, DoubleGemini, Farwood,\u000apoohbear, and Rugrats #1-5 (and of course us - Groundhog &amp;\u000aShadow). I know there will be at least 1 more cacher added to this\u000alist soon!</p>\u000aMuggles will be a slight problem, but mostly in the winter when the\u000aleaves will be off the bushes and the path will be in full view of\u000aa muggle\u2019s house, so stealth will be required.<br>\u000a<p>Rated as wheelchair accessible, although I can't remember if\u000athere's a step up onto the bridge. Path is hardpacked dirt, but not\u000apaved.</p>

VThe final cache contains a log book and pencil, as well as stickers for trading (I didn't want to make you go through all that trouble for a micro with nothing in it!)\u000a\u000aAnd now some history:\u000a\u000aTRU- Although it has been a place of post secondary education for over 30 years, in 2005 University College of the Cariboo and British Columbia Open University merged to become Thompson Rivers University. With over 500 faculty members, and 26 000 students, the school is well on its way to becoming an internationally recognized institution. The school offers almost 50 undergraduate degree options, as well as professional career diploma programs, and many certificates for trades and apprenticeships. The students cheer on the TRU Wolf pack, the athletic teams, and watch performances by TRUdat, the theatre group. The school motto is "Quansem Ilep" (To strive ahead). There are a number of clubs to join, including a fraternity and a sorority, and the TRUSU, the student union, who organizes numerous activities and campaigns on behalf of the student body.\u000a\u000aVexillology- the scholarly study of flags.\u000a\u000aSo, as the name suggests, this cache will take you to various flags on the TRU campus. There are several flags around the campus, which get changed internationally. Feel free to mention any flags you recognize in your log!\u000a\u000a\u000aI would recommend you try this cache on weekends or evenings, to avoid masses of students.\u000a\u000aI would suggested you walk to the various locations, instead of driving, so people can get a view of the campus and a view of the city, too.\u000a\u000aParking is available for a small fee ($3.00), but there are various spots around campus with short term meters as well, or you could park near-by and walk over. Also, the university has very good bus service.\u000a\u000aTo start with, your direction is "check the middle flag".\u000a\u000aThis is my first multi, and I think it will be direct enough, but if there is some confusion, let me know, and I'll try to clarify. Thanks, and Happy Caching!

VWe've placed this TB Hotel very close to the airport to make it\u000aeasy for out-of-towners to drop off and pick up TBs. If you have a\u000aTB that you want to travel a long distance this may be a good spot\u000ato place it. The cache is also close to Kelowna's main highway, for\u000aeasy access. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe cache is a 5.5 litre waterproof bucket that is easily\u000aaccessible. The cache contains a logbook and pencil, and will be\u000astarting with three TBs. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aWe'd like to see TBs in here at all times if possible so that no\u000aone arrives to find an empty bucket. :-( If you're going to take a\u000aTB please check its log page to see its goals, and only take the TB\u000aif you can help it achieve them. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font color="red"><b>Please ensure that you re-hide the cache well,\u000aand watch out for muggles.

VThis cache is acessed via a loop trail and can be reached either of 2 ways. There is a small pullout parking area near the trailhead at N 50 43.628, W 120 30.569 with about 180 m of elevation gain from the trailhead to the cache. Head east from the trailhead for a  2.3 km 45 min hike to the cache or go northwest for about a 2.0 km 40 minute hike. Either way, the loop trail makes for a great hike. Please don't take quads, 4 by 4's or motor bikes into this area as it's a Provincial Park with a very delicate desert ecosystem. Take lots of water with you in the summertime.

VThis cache has only small trade items - coins, jewelry and pins. \u000a\u000aThe Hudson's Bay Fur Trading Company had a graveyard near their post but the small village of Kamloops developing to the East of the Post needed one as well.  A local farmer John Peterson gave some land to the Government Agent John Ussher for that purpose.  Ussher was subsequently murdered in 1879 by the McLean Gang.  The Townsite Syndicate eventually bought Peterson's land and the cemetery was included in the sale.  The Syndicate began charging interment fees and Peterson himself had to pay $8.00 to bury his wife on land he had donated.  The cemetary became crowded, neglected and overgrown. This entire park was once the cemetery, with most of the grave sites unmarked.  The derelict cemetery was eventually tended and the surviving headstones were all moved to this one corner. You can visit them today and catch a brief glimpse of Kamloops history.

VThis is a log only cache.\u000a\u000aThis cache is by the school R.L.C (Robert L. Clemitson), up in the Barnhartvale area of Kamloops. It is very busy during the school hours and I think it would be best to do it on a weekend, but, there are still mugglers so watch out. There is a small hill to walk up but, there are also stairs.  The school has granted permission for this cache.

VThis cache is on the schools millennium trail on the far North side of the school. The trail was created in the year of 2000 by the school, and the wetlands in 2006 by a class and a visitor. The cache is about 20 meters away from the wetland and is just off the millennium trail. Since the trail is six years old it is starting to wear away and it is hard to see, but, it is going to be redone soon. \u000a\u000aIn the Fall of 2006 the wetland was built/constructed by some of the students at RLC School with a wildlife biologist (Tom R. Biebighauser). Tom came to Kamloops to teach about wetland construction and to build a few sample wetlands in Kamloops and area. Tom was sponsored to come from the States by a number of concerned local conservation groups.\u000a\u000aPlease hide the cache like you found it if not better because it is a very busy place with the school and the trail itself. The best place for parking is in the school parking lot. You also need to be stealthy. This is a log only cache and has no pencil or pen so bring your own.

VI have lived in the area for 17 years and Dyelo has lived in the area most of her life -- we won't say how long that is, and neither of us had ever visited these magnificent falls before placing this cache!\u000a\u000aThis is a spectacular 60 foot waterfall dropping along Beaver Creek.  This is a dramatic plunge through a steep canyon.  There is a spur trail that leads down to a viewpoint and on down to the base of the falls.  It would appear the "locals" have installed a rope in a slump area, whereby the kids pull themselves back up the slope.\u000a\u000aPlease exercise extreme caution near the edge, on the trail down (if you should be so bold) and the rope pull (if you should try)!\u000a\u000aThere is NO need to go near the edge to find the cache.\u000a\u000aThe Beautiful British Columbia Mini H2O Tour or BBCM H2O Tour is approximately 110 kilometres, taking a loop from Salmo, south to Nelway, west along the Pend-d\u2019Oreille River Valley (Part of the Dewdney Trail and planned part of the Trans Canada Trail) to Waneta, north towards Montrose and then NNE and finally east via Fruitvale back to Salmo.\u000a\u000aThere is an abundance of water in most of this gorgeous province.  Water is the lifeblood of man and beast.  We have tamed nature\u2019s food for:  power, irrigation for farming, drinking water, recreation in the form of swimming, boating, fishing, camping, panoramic viewing, and even gold panning.  There should be evidence of all these examples and perhaps a few more on this tour!\u000a\u000aThe tour can be done in any direction, with each of the 14 caches leading up to the final being stand alone caches, but keep in mind that the final cache \u2013 Nature\u2019s Gift is near Salmo; said to be home to the finest drinking water in the land!!!\u000a\u000aAt ten of the caches you will find a clue that is written on both the lid of the container and the first page of the log book.  Sound familiar?  Record this clue.  Four of the caches don\u2019t contain a clue, but which ones don\u2019t?  Well I guess you will have to do the circuit to find out!\u000a\u000aIt is best to park at N49 06.026, W117 33.594 and walk the easy 1.6 km along the old line to the cache.  There is a much shorter route, but I haven't determined if it is through private property as yet.\u000a\u000aYou are looking for a cammoed tobacco tin with original contents of: FTF, Stuffy worm, ball, pin, spirit rocks, Cure Kids Cancer bracelet and Koosh ball.\u000a\u000aEnjoy the view, but watch the kids!!!!  Continue with the tour!

VAbout 1.5 km beyond the end of the pavement on the Lac Du Bois Grasslands road, turn left onto the gravel road to the communciations tower site.  It is kind of rough in spots, but 2WD accessible.  Approximately 2 km up this road is a locked gate and a good spot just below it to park.  From here follow your GPS across the grasslands.  There are some trails, but these are only partially helpful.  The direct walking distance is less than 700 m.  The terrain slopes upward and becomes more steep as you appoach the cache.  \u000a\u000aThis is rattlesnake country so keep your eyes open.  Ground cactus is present too.   Between that and the rattlesnakes, I can't recommend this as a dog-friendly site.  And of course, there will also be ticks in season.\u000a\u000aThe earlier cautions (snake den and cliff) don't really apply anymore as of May 19th, 2008.  Entries from May 17th and 19th in the logs below, will explain why.  I checked a 25 m radius around the new site and found no sign of potential rattlesnake dens.  The view however is still pretty good.  Maybe better than before.  I'd recommend bringing your camera.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a small ammo case.  When placed it contained 4 novelty keychains, a small pair of scissors, a fingernail cutter, a deck of cards, a logbook with a mechanical pencil plus refill leads.

It is an up hill walk but, not steep. It's an old road that is now used for hydro. When you are on the New Trail Bridge you will be able to see the road that cuts up along the side of the mountain.

VThe Paulson Bridge is located on a gorge along the "Blueberry-Paulson" section of Highway 3 (between Castlegar and Christina Lake BC).\u000a\u000aThis bridge uses an arch design. The basic design of the arch was perfected by the Romans. Arch bridges are very strong structures. Each end of an arch bridge is anchored\u000afirmly with the bridge curving up toward the middle (just the underside in this case).\u000a\u000aWe have named this bridge Deception as the height looks much further than it really is -- The length is about three times the height!!\u000a\u000aThere is parking and paved road at both stages of this cache. Please replace cache and hide as found. If trading, think small as cache is a locking plastic container measuring 1.5x3x6 inches.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to climb, unless one wants to get a better view below the bridge. In this case, use extreme caution! Original contents are: FTF prize, ball mark repair, frog, colorful eraser, superhost pin, bag clip, keychain and marbles. \u000a\u000aAt the above coordinates, you will find a sign with\u000ameasurements of the Paulson Bridge. Height=a, Length=b,\u000aElevation=c, Arch Span=d. Calculations: Use a & b to calculate the latitude of the final location. Use c & d to calculate the longitude of the final location.\u000a[(a+b)x(3/2)]-15=xxx    c-d-132=yyy\u000aNew coordinates = N 49 11.xxx and W 118 06.yyy \u000a\u000aIf you are into cycling abanded rail grades, a popular day ride in the Castlegar area is to exit Highway #3 at the detour road about two km east of this bridge. Turn right on the rail trail and ride the 2% grade back to Keenleyside Dam. For further information on this rail trail go to www.castlegar.com/columbia_western.htm\u000a

VWith the tree cover we weren\u2019t getting good accuracy so we\u2019re not sure how close the coordinates are.  Oh well, Santa can find everyone\u2019s Christmas tree to put presents under!  Right?  The christmas cache is hidden in a tin within a rectangular plastic container which is in a green cloth bag.  Regular trading items will be in the plastic container, which holds the christmas tin.  If you take from the Christmas tin, please replace with a Christmas theme item.  Please ensure that the cache is replaced as found.\u000a\u000aIn 1974 Margaret Pearse donated the land for Pearse Park for the recreation and enjoyment of the community of Westwold.  There are a few picnic tables near the highway in this mini-forest of mostly pines.  The park seems to be a little neglected, so the trails are not well maintained.  However, it\u2019s a nice place to stretch your legs and take your dog for a walk. Remember our motto "Cache In and Trash Out!"  \u000a\u000aI decided to do a Christmas theme cache here because this small farming community of Westwold, having only a few business establishments, has a large Christmas store open all year long!  You'll have to check it out if you have time as the indoor light displays are great!  There\u2019s also the General Store & Café, the Route 97 Diner & Bakery, and an antique emporium store -- and that's about it in Westwold, other than the old church and the school. You can't get lost here, but it's a great place to stop, shop and have a bite to eat! \u000a\u000aWhen I purchased the FTF & 2TF prizes in the Country Christmas Store not far from the cache location, I explained to the proprietor what I was doing, and he gave me a short written history of his community.  \u000a\u000aThis is my shortened version of it\u2019s history: Westwold, actually an extinct volcano, carried the name \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d from the early 1800\u2019s until 1928 when the name was changed.  A postmaster had neglected to register the name, and as \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d was used in Alberta after 1881, a new name was chosen.  The earliest known map naming Grand Prairie is dated 1832.  A cabin was built in 1819 by the North West Company and was used as they passed through the valley. The first land pre-empted was in 1864 by John Grieve, Roger Moore and Edward Grove, and \u201cGrand Prairie\u201d was then officially established.  Their land was transferred to Henry Ingram later that year when Henry also acquired land.  Ingram was part of a syndicate that put camels on the Gold Trail as pack animals.  For several reasons the camels did not work out and several were brought to Ingram\u2019s farm where the camels were sheared for mattress and pillow stuffing.  The community of Westwold was once a very busy and important stopping place that did have a hotel until 1942.  However, it\u2019s importance to outlying communities ceased to exist once the automobile became popular, and now few people stop there. Let's try to change that!

VOpposite this rest area is the charred evidence of the Cedar Hills\u000aforest fire which ignited in the late evening on Friday, August\u000a1,2003. It was discovered and reported by a fire warden. The fire\u000astarted directly across the highway from the rest stop, and in\u000aplaces, it spread onto the other side of the highway a little\u000afurther east, sparing a farm and the Whispering Pines Motel. The\u000aweather and fire intensity at the time were high to extreme. The\u000afire burned over 1,645 hectares of land and one residential home. A\u000afire investigation was completed and the cause was determined to be\u000aa discarded cigarette from a passing motorist. (Most of the above\u000ainfo I received from a Provincial Fire Information Officer). Thanks\u000aalso for those who fought this fire! There is a sign posted in the\u000aburnt section to remind travellers to prevent forest fires. \u000a<p>Although Smokey Bear is not a Canadian icon, many of us grew up\u000awith this fictional character giving us forest fire prevention\u000amessages on posters. Remember Smokey Bear with his forest ranger\u000ahat and shovel in hand? The Smokey Bear campaign started in 1944 is\u000athe longest running public service campaign in the USA\u2019s history.\u000aCheck out the history of Smokey at <a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.smokeybear.com"\u000atarget="_blank">www.smokeybear.com</a>. as it is really interesting\u000aor check out <a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/kids/lyrics/smokey.htm"\u000atarget="_blank">http://www.niehs.nih.gov/kids/lyrics/smokey.htm</a>\u000ato hear his song to take you down memory lane.</p>\u000a<p>REMEMBER --- ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!</p>\u000a<p>Also destroying our forests is the Pine Beetle. Between the\u000awashrooms, there is an info board, \u201cCycle of Nature\u201d, about this\u000aenemy of our forests.</p>

The cache is a 30 cal. ammunition container, and should be easy to find out in the grasslands.  It originally held a variety of Ducks Unlimited stuff, cap, video, duck ID cards, even an alarm clock in case you want to get up early to watch a dawn flight.  It is also the starting point for the travel bug "Hoodie" the merganser.

VThis is my wife and I's first cache.  We had fun putting it together and tried to make it worth someones while to go find it.  Contents include: waterproof camera (leave a picture of yourself), FS Notebook, $10 Gift Certificate to Ric's Grill in Kamloops, cuccumber candal, alien key chain, dream dictionary, bible, UNO card game, squash ball, balloons, toothpicks, Salto Del Laja Key chain, mini tool, GEOCOIN, and ducky key chain.<p>Good grief maybe we should have spread all that stuff through two caches.  Anyway, it's worth the effort to find as the bluffs are spectacular and there is somewhat of a nice view from the top.  The trail to get up the bluffs is quite steep but dose not require ropes or other gear.  Only strong, stable hikers will want to attempt the climb.

VThe area is a natural preserve.  Stay on the trails, and trust your instincts.  The cache is very close to a trail, and although it is well hidden, its location should be easy to see.  Please keep it well covered with the sticks and debris.  This is a good place to practise "cache in and trash out", as it looks like a black bear has used parts of the preserve to stash the trash he takes from peoples garbage cans.  I had no trouble getting a full bag when I placed the cache.  It is a tupperware container with a blue lid.  It contained a deck of playing cards, a folding scissor set, some mosquito repellent, a Kamloops pin, an obsidian arrowhead (from Mexico), a carabiner, a bungee cord, a loonie, an agate from the Queen Charlotte Islands, a foreign coin and a roll of pennies.<br>Parking may pose a problem, but there are lots of streets around.  There is a bench and intrepretive sign near these coordinates 50 38.070   120 20.970

VIn the late 1800's the City of Toronto set about building a new City Hall.  This building was completed in 1899 and was said to be one of the most stunning buildings of its time.  (However, it was later replaced by another structure in 1965 and is now known as Old City Hall.)<br><br>\u000aThe story holds, that the architect of the City Hall wanted more recognition than just his name in small print on the building's cornerstone.  The city fathers refused!  Not to be denied, he had a message incorporated into stone and placed around the entire building.  (As well, his face was set into the entry arches outside the main doors.  All other faces were said to be caricatures, of local politicians, while his face was not a caricature.)<br><br>\u000aThe message starts on the west side of Old City Hall and runs around the four sides of the entire structure.  Each letter of the message is carved onto one of the many corbels just under the roof.  Once you find the first set, the pattern becomes obvious, and you can work your way around the building.<br><br>\u000aTo verify that you have found the proper virtual cache, please email me with the following information:<br><ul>\u000a    <li>What is the text of the message?<br>\u000a    <li>Break the message into the sets, as they are found on the building.</ul><br>\u000aI will email you back and if your answers were correct, you may log your visit to the virtual cache.  Please do not include details in your find that would spoil the fun for others (no encrypted hints either).<br><br>\u000a(Please Note:  Old City Hall is currently undergoing some major renovations and scaffolding may hide some of the text.  Include as much as you can find on the four sides.)\u000a

Each capital city will have a brass cap which is a First Post in a unified system of precisely co-ordinated survey points. Some monuments have a document cache or a time capsule encased to be opened on our 200th birthday. \u000a<p><b>The first survey of land in Canada was made in 1625 on the St. Charles River near the City of Quebec and was made by the man recognized as Canada's first surveyor, Samuel de Champlain.</b>\u000a<p><b><font color=brown>Some early surveyors in Ontario were F.W Beatty, J.G.Pierce,and Sir Sanford Fleming. \u000a<p>In 1906 surveyors started to erect large towers to Triangulate from.

VEverybody is welcome to my cache, but I would love to keep the theme of my cache as girly as possible. It\u2019s a clear Tupperware container with a white lid. The contents of the container are: 2 very cute pink notebooks, 1 pink touch lamp, 1 set of pink and purple hairclips, 4 piece pink scented candles, 3 pink bath bombs, 1 pink face towel, 5 color band-aids, 1 set of pink pens, 1 pink bath glove, 1 pink flower mirror, 1 pair of pink flip-flops, 1 deck of mini cards and 1 FOXY D doll trademark. If you decide to take the ferry to the Island I would recommend you to take the Ward\u2019s Island Ferry, but either one will take you there. I hope you enjoy this cache as much as I enjoyed putting it together for you guys.

VWelcome to my cache, Ghostcache. It is located on the Toronto Islands and is easily accessible by foot, bike, rollerblades or any other mode of transportation (except by car, there are no vehicles allowed on the island except city service ones). Go to the Toronto Island Ferry docks and take any ferry you\u2019d like, there are three, Wards Island ferry dock is about 3 kilometers from Ghostcache, Centre Island ferry is about 1 ½ kilometers and Hanlan\u2019s point ferry is about 2 kilometers  (for ferry schedules and fees please call 416-392-8193). When you get off the ferry simply follow the paved road/trail, it stretches from one end of the island to the other and is a very nice walk. Just keep looking at your GPS and look up when you are close and you\u2019ll see the Gibralter Point Lighthouse (you can\u2019t miss it!), it\u2019s just off the trail. Follow the trail leading into the lighthouse and read the historical plaque on it, it dates back almost 200 years and is supposedly haunted by the restless spirit of one of the original keepers who was murdered over the moonshine he was running from the lighthouse. To this day people claim to see him roaming the grounds around the lighthouse in search of his missing limbs that were cut of by his murderers (for more info on the story, visit www.torontoghosts.org/lighth.htm). Ghostcache is aptly named for the location, and if you are brave, try it at night, that is when the ghost is said to be seen looking for his missing limbs! It is a clear plastic Tupperware container and contains the following,\u000a\u000a1 ceramic ghost\u000a1 ceramic \u201cthree ghosts on a ship\u201d\u000a1 ceramic \u201cSpooky\u201d  ghost travel bug\u000a1 farm animal set (pig, sheep, dog)\u000a1 toy horse with trees\u000a1 pen and pencil set\u000a1 ball\u000a1 set of batteries\u000a1 mini-mug	\u000a6 glow-in-the-dark plastic turtles\u000a\u000a\u000a  There is no particular theme for my cache, and everyone is welcome! Enjoy and happy haunting!!!!!\u000a

VThis is a quick and easy cache, and our first.  It is about 3 times the size of a normal 35mm container and white with a green label.  Not large enough for many trades other than very small ones.  Inside you will find:- logbook and pencils- sharpner- assorted Canada stickers.  If you are not from Canada please take a sticker as a reminder.  If you are, take one with pride.

VThe Niagara is a fairly young river, only 12,000 years old!, a\u000amicrosecond in geological time. The Niagara Escarpment, which was\u000acreated by erosion is much older. <br>\u000a After the last ice age when glaciers pressed down on the area, the\u000aslow process of erosion by ice and water has created this\u000aescarpment.<br>\u000a The mighty river plunges over a cliff of dolostone and shale.\u000aDolostone is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high\u000apercentage of the mineral dolomite. Most dolostone formed as a\u000amagnesium replacement of limestone or lime mud prior to\u000alithification. It is resistant to erosion and can either contain\u000abedded layers or be unbedded. Shale is a rock formed from fine\u000agrained muds and clays. It is characterized by thin laminae\u000abreaking with an irregular curving fracture, often splintery and\u000ausually parallel to the often-indistinguishable bedding plane. This\u000aproperty is called fissility.<br>\u000a Niagara Falls is the second largest falls on the globe next to\u000aVictoria Falls in southern Africa. One fifth of all the fresh water\u000ain the world lies in the four Upper Great Lakes-Michigan, Huron,\u000aSuperior and Erie. All the outflow empties into the Niagara river\u000aand eventually cascades over the falls.<br>\u000a<p>Please note that the posted co-ordinates will bring you to Table\u000aRock near the brink of the falls, but you will still have to look\u000aaround a bit for the required information. The plaque you are\u000alooking for is located at N43 04.861 W79 04.693</p>\u000a<p><b><font color="red"><font size="+1">To Log a find on this\u000abeautiful scenic earthcache you must email us with the dimensions\u000alisted on the historic plaque along with the most recent date of\u000arock fall. You must also take a picture of yourself/team with gps\u000ain hand ,standing with the Canadian Horseshoe Falls behind you (we\u000alove to see other cachers enjoying the view)and post it with your\u000afind log (please no spoiler).</font></font></b></p>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a<a rel="nofollow" href=\u000a     "http://www.ontgeocaching.com"><img src="http://www.ontgeocaching.com/images/ogalink.gif"\u000a     border="0"></a>

VThe cache is off a well-known highway that brings you to Butternut Creek.  You can park your vehicle at N44 15.642, W076 26.638 and begin your walk.  The trail follows the creek and is relatively easy, but parents will want to watch young children as it skirts a rock ledge.  The cache is not far off the trail and bushwhacking is very minimal.  This was created with a family-orientation in mind.

The contents include notepad and pens, Goofy figure, sports car, post-its, CITO containter, Canada keychain/bottle opener, Geocaching keychain/compass, Kellogg's step counter, race car game, necklace, various coupons, and Canadian Tire money (it might as well be gold!).

V<b>One Free Ride</b> is so named because it contains two TTC tokens\u000aas gifts for the "First to Find." After that, this micro becomes a\u000asimple signing cache. <b><i>TOMTEC was the "First to Find", and has\u000athe tokens - congrats TOMTEC!</i></b>\u000a<p>If you wish, bring a bagged lunch and have a seat!</p>\u000a<p><i>There is no pen or pencil in the cache, so be sure to bring\u000asomething along with which to sign the log!</i></p>\u000a<p>UPDATE: I added something coming out of the cache to help make\u000ait retrievable - care should be taken when replacing it, and\u000acachers with a better idea are free to modify the insertion of the\u000acache in any way that aids in its hiding and/or retrieval. Also,\u000awaypoints bounce around a lot here, and the map puts it a little\u000atoo far south. Thanks!</p>

VAt the entrance to the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) is a display commemorating the 100th anniversary of Canadian Military Engineering in 2003.  The display is made up of a Sherman tank named \u201cAthene\u201d, crossing a double span Bailey bridge.  Historic military hardware situated at the entrance to a base, are referred to as being on \u201cSentry\u201d duty.  It is interesting that the bridge crosses an active creek.\u000a\u000aThere is a sign requesting that you do not climb on the monument. Don't worry, no climbing is required for this cache.

VTHE IDEA:\u000aThe level of intensity and degree of obsession among geocachers with the race for \u2018First To Find\u2019 status has caused me no end of amusement. Geocachers are hooked to their internet lifeline awaiting the next flash bulletin announcing the newest hide in their area. Thereupon, all else is immediately dropped and the mad dash is on. Well, this set of caches is my response to this phenomenon. Frustration will almost certainly result from the attempt to seek several far-flung caches simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE RACE:\u000aThere have appeared nine individual FTF Frustration micro caches, numbered 1 to 9, that are hidden near and far. They are to be treated as individual caches, not as a multicache. Those not interested in \u201cthe race\u201d may choose to find any of these caches at a more sedate pace (recommended) and enjoy the scenery along the way. In order to be eligible for the FTF prize though, you must find all nine and submit to all the requirements. Read the descriptions and difficulty ratings carefully. Not all caches are kid-friendly. Frustration is likely, hints are few. Be advised that tree climbing and a head for height may be necessary in some cases. \u000a\u000aTHE POINTS: \u000aThere will be a FTF prize. Qualification for the FTF prize requires the completion of certain conditions. You must find all nine FTF Frustration caches in any order. You must have the highest aggregate point score. Points will be awarded only for the first nine finders of each cache. Scoring will be done according to this chart:\u000aRanking	     Points\u000aFTF ..... 9\u000a2nd ..... 8\u000a3rd ..... 7\u000a4th ..... 6\u000a5th ..... 5\u000a6th ..... 4\u000a7th ..... 3\u000a8th ..... 2\u000a9th ..... 1\u000aYou must show proof of your find by uploading a clear photo showing your name in the log sheet, as well as the previous name listed. I will delete any spoilers, photo or written, until the winner is announced. I, and I alone, will decide the final winner, the prize and the time and method of delivering the prize. I will post the aggregate winner on each of the nine FTF Frustration web pages\u000a\u000aTHIS CACHE:\u000aThe cache is hidden near the Bayridge Drive and Front Road intersection. Nearby are two small lakeside parks at Smugglers Cove and at Horsey Bay, joined by a scenic walk along Old Front Road. A golf course and a small airport are in the vicinity. A short drive away is Lemoines Point Conservation Area. The car may be pulled off the road to park. If crossing the road, be careful of traffic coming around the corner.\u000a{My caches #2-9 \u2018FTF Frustration\u2019 series placed at 63 finds}\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on your FTF! **\u000a\u000a                \u000a** ** ** ** ** ** HONOUR ROLL ** ** ** ** ** **\u000a\u000a( All 9 of the FTF Frustration Series completed )\u000a\u000aMay 27 07............bluenoserstoo\u000aNov 14 07..............mTn_biKer65\u000aApr 24 08..................2 paddlers\u000aSep 15 08..................kayakers2\u000aDec 03 08...............KayakGeokid\u000aSep 09 09...............Trail Blaisers\u000aOct 20 09...............AaronHaynes\u000a.

VThe McLean House (Kingston Frontenac) Library and 6 hectares of\u000atrails overlooking the Great Catarqui River are two of Kingston's\u000alesser known treasures and you may have driven by them both every\u000aday and not even noticed! McLean House/Hawthorn Cottage is a 140\u000ayear-old farm house incorporated into a new library building. It\u000awas built in 1866 by John and Sarah Ruttan. The Ruttan family\u000acommissioned the building of the house while Mr. Ruttan was first\u000areeve of Pittsburgh Township. The building, erected by local\u000astonemasons is a typical, rather fine, mid-nineteenth century\u000aOntario one and one-half storey stone farm house. It and the\u000asurrounding land between Highway 15 and the Great Cataraqui River\u000awere purchased by Pittsburgh Township for municipal purposes, and\u000ain 1997 it was chosen to be the site for new Pittsburgh Branch of\u000athe Kingston Frontenac Public Library.

V<p>My first cache, dedicated to kids and to those who are kids at\u000aheart. Hopefully we will never lose that sense of awe and adventure\u000athat is an integral part of the fun of discovery.</p>\u000a<p>I chose a location with kids in mind. Rotary Park at Lemoines\u000aPoint has a convenient parking lot, great play equipment, access to\u000athe lake, washrooms nearby, open grassy fields, picnic area, and\u000amany wooded trails. Some of the closer pathways are paved and\u000atherefore wheelchair accessible. The park is family friendly, dog\u000afriendly and free to enjoy. Bring your own food and drink. As I was\u000ascouting out a hiding place I came across a family of white-tail\u000adear at the cache site. We stared at each other for a long while.\u000aThey only scampered off when I reached for my camera.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is a medium sized plastic jar covered with duct tape.\u000aIt is filled exclusively with kid-related items. The cache is\u000ahidden in the woods on the other side of the road only a short walk\u000afrom the playground and up a short incline. It can be found under\u000asome big rocks. Of course adults should accompany young kids to the\u000acache site and maybe help them with their search. The cache should\u000anot be difficult to find. For those interested in a greater\u000achallenge or in racking up finds, there are other caches at\u000aLemoines Point Conservation Area.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on the FTF!</p>

VThis cache is to help bring more visitors to Woodbine Park, and to add on to the only other cache in the park, Woodbine Park Ponds. If you want to be near the Beach but still have some peace, you can easily spend a quiet hour strolling the paths or taking a seat by the fountain pond... or the marsh pond... or play with the kids in the splash pad (a MUST for all in the summer, I don't care how old you are!).\u000a\u000aIt's a Kraft peanut butter jar. There was a pen in the cache but it might have been used as a trade after all.\u000a\u000aPlease keep the pens in the cache, I think the first one got traded.\u000a\u000aGet to the park by TTC on Coxwell bus 22 or 22A. Ask the driver if you can get off at Eastern Av.(depending on the time of day). If you can't, then get off at Queen Street East and head south on Coxwell, cross over Eastern Avenue and voila you should see the welcoming flags.\u000a\u000aYou can park at the lots on Eastern Av. opposite the Alliance Atlantis Cinemas, or off Lakeshore at the Boardwalk Pub. Make sure of your spot... sometimes you have to pay... sometimes you don't!

VYou will be visiting Severn Creek Park, named for the creek that once flowed here and supported a number of early Yorkville businesses. It's now covered over... is it still flowing to the Don River? The north entrance to the park has a didactic panel which will tell you more! \u000a\u000aYou can enter from the north or south, allowing parking both ways, or from the Rosedale Subway station.\u000a\u000aThe north entrance is on Crescent Road, just off Yonge St. If you come from the subway, turn right you'll almost bump into the park sign!\u000a\u000aTHE NORTH ENTRANCE HAS STAIRS. THE SOUTH ENTRANCE IS LEVEL, FOR ANYONE NEEDING AN ACCESSIBLE ENTRY. \u000a\u000aThe south entrance is on Rosedale Valley Rd. north of the intersection with Park Rd. If you come via Aylmer Rd and Yonge St., you'll take the overpass and make a sharp left.\u000aBring some quarters for the parking meter just in case.\u000a\u000aMany cachers have scaled the hill from Rosedale Valley Road lately. Please don't, for your own safety and to protect the vegetation on the slope.\u000a\u000aThe cache is WITHIN THE PARK BOUNDARY and you shouldn't need to go more than 10ft off the grass.\u000a\u000aIt's a bigger Kraft peanut butter container.\u000a\u000aLots of summer growth and the lower lying location of the cache may affect your satellite capture. Getting a fix earlier on in your outing might help. It was placed in March when there was no cover, and coords appear to have been reliable.

From the cache look northeast towards the building with all the satellite dishes on it and you might see one of us watching you.  \u000aNorway Park which was constructed in 1986 to serve the needs of the local residents.   Its name commemorates the World War II training base, used by the Norwegian Air Force, that once existed on the site. Existing park facilities include a baseball diamond and soccer pitch, playground and wading pool, as well as landscaped gardens and art installations.  \u000aPlease bring your own writing instrument as the cache is to small to hold one.  Stealth will be required depending on the time of day as muggles frequent the park.

VIn July 2003, on vacation on Cape Cod, a group of friends decided to try out a new sport, \u201cgeocaching\u201d.  With this first find, Bluelamb03 was born.  Bluelamb03 took to geocaching with enthusiasm.  Since that July day, Bluelamb03 has cached from his own backyard (not literally) to a stranger\u2019s backyard (literally) and across the ocean.  He has established caches in Canada and the UK.  In addition, he is a fervent promoter of the sport and a zealous member of Ottawa\u2019s \u201cSaturday Morning Caching Club\u201d aka the Geomob.\u000a\u000aOne of the trailheads is up by Hwy 15 at N44 15.225 W76 27.640.  If you follow your GPS to the closest spot, you will end up on the wrong side of a fence.

VThis is our very first cache.We hope you enjoy it.Here is an interesting story about the bay. \u000a\u000aWelcome to Deadman\u2019s Bay. The story goes like this. In the 1940\u2019s a man named Robert James was hired to build the gunnery known as Cathart Tower on Cedar Island. He met a beautiful girl named Elizabeth they fell in love and were to be married. One day as all the men were getting ready for a day off from work they noticed a storm was starting to brew. So 23 of the men jumped into the boat making for very tight quarters. The waters were raging and the boat overturned. Robert James died leaving Elizabeth alone and devastated. She refused to eat and died shortly after. To this day there are stories of a woman around the tower staring off into the bay. Maybe you too will get a chance to come across her. Good Luck and Have fun.\u000a\u000a\u000aBring your own writing stick. \u000aNo room for trade items.\u000aWalk towards the beach area there you will find the path.\u000a\u000aTo the FTF: A note with instructions will be placed in the cache for your FTF prize.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS!!! BINRAT A JOB WELL DONE :)

Founded in 1792 by\u000aReverend John Stewart based upon a grant for secondary education in\u000athe colony of Upper Canada, it moved to its present location in\u000a1892. It is considered the oldest secondary school in Ontario.\u000aGirls were first admitted as students in January, 1877 and the\u000aschool has remained co-educational since.The oldest remaining wing\u000aof the school is the 1915 wing, which now houses science\u000alaboratories. The original wing was burned down in a fire and\u000areplaced. Several notable graduates include Peter Milliken, Helen\u000aCooper, David Usher, and the members of The Tragically Hip.</i>\u000a<br>\u000a<p>As a current student at this awesome school, I thought it\u000aappropriate to commemorate it and show some spirit through a\u000afavorite sport. The cache is a small black tin, containing lots of\u000arandom items, a log bog + pencil, and the geocaching sheet. Please\u000aleave something if you take something.

VI have modified the cache so that it may be completed by justing using information at each site.  If you chose this route use the alternate "On site" clue instead of the first clue at some of the sites.\u000aIf you want to solve the original cache use the first clue and come pre-armed with the following knowledge:\u000a1. Gun armament of past jet fighters used by the RCAF\u000a2. The main heavy guns used in British Fortifications circa 1812.\u000a3. Canadian tanks guns since WWII.\u000a  \u000a\u000aMost of this information can be quickly found on the net.  You may have to dig a little for the 1812 info, but that is not too hard in this town.\u000a\u000aThe sites are numbered in a rough tour, you can do them in any order, but bear in mind site 8 is close to the final cache location.\u000a\u000aTime for completion is about 2-3 hours.\u000a\u000aRMC is open to the public during the day. In the evenings it is still open but the commissionaires will record your license plate and ask your intentions (looking at the military hardware displays).  After midnight there is no admittance.  \u000a\u000aCache is a small round container.\u000a\u000aThe size of gun is always in the unit used for that gun during its use.  For example; inches, millimeters or pounds.\u000a\u000aCache is located at: 44 AB.CDE, 76 FG.HIJ\u000a\u000aCongrats to Swimmrguy on the FTF!

A\u000a\u201csavannah\u201d is broadly defined as a discontinuous canopy of tree\u000acover with a ground layer of grasses and wildflowers, and is\u000aconsidered to be a transition zone between prairie and the eastern\u000adeciduous forest. It is the combination of the two habitats that\u000agives oak savannah its own unique identity. Savannah is a globally\u000aendangered vegetation community. Human settlement has reduced it to\u000a0.01% of its original extent. \u000a<p>Only at High Park can you still get a glimpse of the variety of\u000ahabitats which once occurred throughout Toronto. It is our\u000aconnection to Toronto\u2019s wilderness past, but it has not escaped\u000aunscathed. It has lost more than half of its rare plant species\u000aover the last 90 years and one-third of its nesting bird species\u000aover the last 50 years, as well as many of its rare insect species\u000asuch as the Karner Blue butterfly. Despite the loss of natural\u000aareas to make way for other uses, High Park still supports a\u000aremarkable variety of rare flora and vegetation communities.</p>\u000a<p>High Park is the last sizeable natural area remaining on\u000aToronto\u2019s Iroquois Sand Plain. These sands were laid down on the\u000ashores of glacial Lake Iroquois, the larger version of Lake\u000aOntario, that was formed when the glaciers retreated from our area\u000aabout 12,800 years ago. The coarse, sandy soils are relatively warm\u000aand dry. This \u201cedaphic\u201d feature has allowed savannah plants to\u000asuccessfully colonize and expand their range well to the east of\u000athe traditional warm and dry prairies of central North America.</p>\u000a<p>The oak savannahs of High Park are considered \u201ccontinentally\u000asignificant\u201d by virtue of their location, at the northern edge of\u000athe geographic zone of occurrence, and the size, nature and\u000acharacteristics of the remnant ecological community they comprise.\u000aThese ecological features are nonetheless impoverished. For\u000aexample, the dominant Black Oak trees, over 150 years of age, are\u000anot regenerating. Regenerating is used rather than reproducing\u000abecause the oaks do set viable crops of acorns. It is from that\u000apoint onward that the life cycle of a Black Oak is impaired. At\u000aleast 50% of these Black Oaks are diseased or heart- rotted. In\u000arecent years, successive dry summers coupled with successive Fall\u000aCankerworm infestations have contributed to the demise of a\u000asubstantial fraction of these old oak trees. The Parks Department\u000ahas embarked on a program which includes acorn collection and\u000agermination as well as insect and squirrel population monitoring so\u000aas to curtail the demise of this tree species.</p>\u000a<p>As well as identifying eco-system features there should be an\u000aunderstanding of eco-system function. A function that is\u000acharacteristic to savannah is fire. The whole host of savannah\u000aflora and fauna are in some way fire-dependant. For instance, young\u000aBlack Oak trees tolerate fire by exhibiting a unique ability to\u000aresprout stems following top kill by fire, when their competition\u000acan not. Also, large Black Oak trees develop a fire resistant,\u000ainsulating bark which gives them a competitive advantage. The Parks\u000aDepartment recognizes the necessity of fire, and has thus conducted\u000aseveral controlled, or prescribed burns in the past few years.\u000aResults have been encouraging, and the Department will continue to\u000ause the services of professional fire practitioners for years to\u000acome.</p>\u000a<p>Forty species of the park\u2019s native plants are known to occur in\u000aonly four other places in Metro Toronto. Four of these species\u000a(Wood Betony, Shrubby St. John\u2019s-Wort, Wild Lupine and Cup-Plant)\u000aare known to occur in four other places in Canada. What we have in\u000aHigh Park is truly unique and rare.</p>\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>

VTTC access from Castle Frank subway station.\u000a\u000aBefore you go off on the hunt, look up the word for "mother" in a Finnish dictionary.\u000a\u000aYou don't have to do the questions in order. In fact, you may want to plan out your own order of doing them, based on which ones are closer to each other if you want to avoid hours of walking back and forth.\u000a\u000aFor each of the questions, fill in the number required in the blanks. If one of the digits of the answer coincides with a letter instead of a blank, then assign that letter to that digit. For example, if the answer 1882 goes in the blanks _ _ Y _, then Y = 8.\u000a\u000aIf there is more than one occurence of a letter, then add up all the values that letter receives. For example, if you must write down the year 1935 in the slot _ _ X _, and then later the number 12 in the slot _ X, then X would be equal to the sum of 3 and 2. X = 5. \u000a\u000aIf this sum is higher than 9 (more than one digit long), then add up its digits, for example if M comes up three times and its answers are 5, 3 and 9, then add them up to 17, then add up 1 and 7, so now you know that M = 8.\u000a\u000aFor the letters A, B, F and G there is only one answer to fill. For C and E, you will have to add up two digits. For D, there are 3 answers to add up.\u000a\u000aThe final cache is hidden at:\u000a43 degrees 40.ADC North\u000a79 degrees 2B.EFG West\u000a\u000aThe final is located approximately 100 metres from one of the three cemetery entrances/exits described in the waypoints.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Barnie's Band of Gold, who was first to find!!\u000a\u000aEnjoy!

In 1880, in London, England, he became the\u000aworld\u2019s professional rowing champion. Hanlan was born in Toronto,\u000aOntario. When his parents moved to Toronto Island, where his father\u000awas a hotel keeper, he had to cross Toronto Harbour to attend\u000aGeorge Street Public School on the mainland. The only way to reach\u000athe mainland was by boat.

When he was 18, he rowed his first shell and won the Toronto\u000aamateur sculling championship. At age 21, in 1876, Hanlan won in\u000athe Philadelphia Centennial Regatta, on the Schuylkill River,\u000aagainst 15 professionals and established a new world\u2019s record over\u000aa three-mile course for single sculls\u000acompetition.</font></font></p>\u000a<div align="center">\u000a<center><br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<table cellpadding="0" width="704" id="table1">\u000a<tr>\u000a<td valign="top">\u000a<p align="center"><img height="276"\u000asrc="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8058f7a2-1277-45e2-9c10-3c52764359dc.jpg" />\u000a</p>\u000a<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b>Artist Fredric Marlett\u000aBell-Smith painted the skyline in the background of this 1880 view\u000adepicting the new world champion sculler Ned Hanlan in the Toronto\u000aharbour as photographed by Thomas Hunter [C.J.

During\u000araces Hanlan would occasionally stop, wave impishly to spectators,\u000awash his face, even bend over to sponge water from his shell until\u000acompetitors caught up to him.

John\u000aHoward, one of Toronto\u2019s first architects as well as a City\u000aEngineer and Surveyor, built Colborne Lodge in 1837 which still\u000acontains many original furnishings, artifacts, and some of his own\u000awatercolours depicting images of early Toronto. Colborne Lodge\u2019s\u000aextensive ornamental and kitchen gardens are now being restored.\u000aTour the Lodge or come and enjoy the Harvest Festival, Christmas\u000acelebrations or celebrate Doors Open Toronto with the museum\u2019s\u000afriendly and knowledgeable staff.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b><font size="4">John Howard Tomb</font></b><br />\u000a<br />\u000aJohn Howard designed this tomb in High Park for his wife and\u000ahimself in 1874-75. (Jemima Howard died in 1877 and John passed\u000aaway in 1890). Like Colborne Lodge, this was a romantic structure,\u000abut it represented a heavy Victorian romanticism in contrast to the\u000alighter version articulated in his Regency lodge.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aJohn Howard married Jemima Frances Meikle in 1827. Jemima (1802-77)\u000asometimes prepared copies of specifications in John's architectural\u000aand engineering practice. She also was an amateur watercolourist,\u000abut did not document the city's life, focusing instead on romantic\u000aimages. The Howards' relationship seems to have been incomplete:\u000aJohn engaged in a long-term clandestine relationship with another\u000awoman, Mary Williams, with whom he had three children, whereas he\u000aand Jemima had none. Yet during Jemima's final illness - with\u000acancer - John did his utmost to find a cure and to care for her,\u000aand seems to have grieved her loss with deep sincerity.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<p>- - -<br />\u000a<br />\u000aA children's garden and small zoo are nearby.</p>

VWhat better place for a hide than right under the noses of the\u000aguards. Yes, you are being watched, so be cool, and act natural.\u000aThis is the (former) P4W, which closed about 10 years ago, and now\u000ahouses the <a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.penitentiarymuseum.ca/museum/museum_home.htm">PENITENTIARY\u000aMUSEUM</a>. The adjacent site, very close by to the north, has been\u000asold to Queen's University. To the south is the infamous Kingston\u000aPen, home to the worst criminals in Canada. All the structures on\u000athis property...buildings, fences, stonework, etc, were all built\u000aby inmates. \u000a<p>The site is open to the public. The vehicle entrance is off Sir\u000aJohn A MacDonald Blvd SOUTHBOUND ONLY, south of Union street, north\u000aof King Street. There is plenty of free car parking. The most\u000ainteresting way to GZ however, is the short walk from Portsmouth\u000aOlympic Harbour, just across the street (also plenty of free car\u000aparking). There is an ornate gate on King street, right across from\u000athe main entrance to Kingston Pen.</p>\u000a<p>The site has lots of green space and is kid and dog friendly. It\u000ais an easy 2 minute walk to GZ, no bushwacking. There is no snow\u000aremoval to GZ however, so snow can be a problem. This cache can be\u000adone in under 10 minutes. The museum, open during the summer\u000amonths, is excellent, and includes real jail cells (entrance fee is\u000aby donation, usually one coin).</p>\u000a<p>The walls of the prison have now been removed, the site cleaned\u000aup, and the construction/demolition ended. Access from Union street\u000ais now an interesting alternate route to the cache. There is a\u000apaved path at the extreme west end of the grounds, right below the\u000aone remaining wall. As you walk this path, see the remains of the\u000aprison, and try to imagine the women who once called this\u000ahome....spooky.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to Hypocorism on the FTF.<br />\u000aCongratulations also to all the others who braved the cold, wind,\u000asnow and dark to find this cache on Nov 30 for the FARE THEE WELL\u000aBN2 event</p>\u000a<p>FTF Hypocorism<br />\u000a2TF Bluesaway<br />\u000a3TF Cumbrian Lass<br />\u000a4TF Skottikus<br />\u000a5TF Remote Sensor + Greenleaf<br />\u000a6TF Team Jevre</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

VNO FENCES TO CLIMB...USE THE GATE (see photo below) \u000a<p>The cache is on the grounds of Corrections Canada Staff College.\u000aThe north side of the property is the DOG TRAINING AREA.

Remember to bring your canine friends.</p>\u000a<p>VISITORS (and their dogs) ARE WELCOME, provided they abide by\u000athe rules. In short, you (and your dog) must not bother or distract\u000aa dog in training.

If you aproach from the north, USE THE\u000aGATE just west of the ball diamond (see gallery...don't rip your\u000apants on the chain link fence like others before you). Either way,\u000aGZ is a short walk (200m) from parking. Deep snow will make access\u000adifficult.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is not on the ground, or even near the ground. It is\u000avisible from a short distance. It will be a physical challenge to\u000aget the cache once you see it. Please use caution getting the\u000acache. If in doubt, leave it...it's just a game. Do not try to get\u000athis cache in icy/slippery/wet conditions. You do not have to\u000aretrieve the cache yourself, but to log as a find, you must get\u000ayour name into the log book, somehow.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to Hypocorism on the FTF on a cold and snowy\u000anight.<br />\u000a Honourable mention must also go to George (of BN2), and\u000aGuardian14.<br />\u000a Although there are other names in the log, these are the first\u000aMONKEYS who braved the elements to actually retrieve the cache.\u000aWell done!</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

VAnother great spot in Kingston for a quick cache grab.  (I hope). When ever we take a tour to K-Town this is one of our stops.  I am sure some members of your family too would sooner be caching than shopping. Looking forward to reading about any "flash mobs".  Include pictures!!!  And enjoy the cache!!!

Might be an easy find. :) If you find this cache during the day - please take some time and visit the building nearby. Free admission and lots of neat and interesting displays. Besides you can even press red buttons. You know you want to find out what the red button does. \u000a\u000ahere's the link to the nearby building.

V<p>When a bunch of cachers in the Kingston area got together, a\u000adiscussion ensued that the Kingston Area Geocachers (KAG) should\u000adevelop a logo. It was felt that the logo should be simple, yet\u000acapture some unique identification of Kingston. Although I am not\u000aan artist by any stretch of the imagination, I do love an excuse to\u000aplay around with new computer programs.</p>\u000a<p>This is what I came up with:</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img border="0" src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c0f21d12-98b9-47be-ba6b-dfbdc888fa51.jpg">\u000a</a></center>\u000a<p>Whether I succeeded to capture a unique K-town identity, I'll\u000aleave you to decide. But wait! <i>What if I could hide a cache\u000aright inside the logo?</i></p>\u000a<p>Members of KAG have shown themselves to be adventurous, and open\u000ato new challenges. You might have to explore some new skills to\u000afind this cache. But with a little homework and a few steps, you\u000awill be able to find it. <i>There is an unactivated geocoin for the\u000aFTF.</i></p>\u000a<p>Please don't post any spoilers in the logs. Let everyone have\u000athe chance to see if this logo does an adequate job!</p>\u000a<p>You can check your answers for this puzzle <a target="_blank"\u000ahref=\u000a"http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=7aa057d035d0c1868c28c13507874eb8&amp;action=check&amp;wp=474331355a434e&amp;name=43616e20596f75205069637475726520546869733f&amp;language=">\u000ahere</a>.</p>\u000a<center><strong>Congratulations to Remote Sensor on the\u000aFTF!</strong></center>\u000a<br>\u000a<br>\u000a \u000a<center><a href="http://www.ontgeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/%7Erconnell/images/ogalink.gif" width="250"\u000aheight="106" border="0"></a></center>

VThe cache is a micro (film canister). There is a log book and a first to find prize inside! A small pencil is also included, but its better to bring your own pen or pencil just in case. A short walk after parking is required, but its a nice, easy walk. Check road-side parking restrictions before parking!\u000a\u000aCongrats Guardian14 on the FTF ... at 3AM.  Nice Job!

VEasy find at a fast food joint. It is camo'd not hidden. No need to\u000amove any rocks or lift anything. It is not on the ground but it is\u000afairly low. It is not a skirtlifter. \u000a<p>Celebrate your find with a happy meal, or drown your DNF sorrows\u000ain a McFlurry.</p>\u000a<p>In 1954, 52-year-old salesman Ray Kroc was a distributor for\u000a"Multimixer" milkshake machines when he came across the small\u000ahamburger stand of Dick and Mac McDonald in San Bernardino,\u000aCalifornia. The McDonald brothers didn't want to oversee any new\u000arestaurants, so Kroc became their franchising agent. Kroc formed\u000athe franchising company on March 2, 1955, under the name of\u000aMcDonald's System, Inc.</p>\u000a<p>There are about 31,000 McDonald's worldwide.</p>\u000a<p>On May 3, 2000, Dave Ulmer hid a bucket of trinkets in the woods\u000aoutside Portland, Oregon and announced its location on the\u000ainternet. Mike Teague was FTF, exclaiming "Woo-Hoo, there should be\u000alike a special prize for FTF". Within days there were caches hidden\u000aacross the USA. On May 8, 2000, Teague made a Web site for\u000acollecting the locations of caches.</p>\u000a<p>There are almost 1 million geocaches worldwide.</p>\u000a<p>Today these two global phenomena converge as McCache!</p>\u000a<p>Takes 5 minutes or less. Watch out for cars at GZ. Street\u000aparking very close, or free parking a few metres north of GZ at\u000aBlockbuster Video. Easy, flat terrain.</p>\u000a<p>They named one of their special BIG hamburgers after one of the\u000abrothers. It's a good thing they didn't name it after the other\u000abrother!</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to:<br />\u000aFTF Swimmrguy<br />\u000a2TF Bluesaway<br />\u000a3TF GlenburnieHawkeye</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>

V<br />\u000aAs is to be expected, GPS signals are a bit erratic in this\u000aneighbourhood. Nevertheless, the posted coordinates were obtained\u000afrom multiple readings taken on several visits to the site, and so\u000aare as accurate as we can make them.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThis is a log only cache, so don&rsquo;t forget to bring a pen, and\u000aplease write as small as you can! <b>In fact, please restrict your\u000alog entry to initials. That way we don't have to replace the log\u000aevery five minutes.</b><br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe cache is outdoors. You don&rsquo;t need to go in the Cloud\u000aForest Conservatory to find it.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease take extra special care not to drop the cache when\u000aretrieving and replacing it. Naturally, since this is a city centre\u000alocation, &lsquo;surreptitious&rsquo; should be your watchword (and\u000aa mighty-fine word it is, too!).<br />\u000a<br />\u000aIf you&rsquo;re a purist... we&rsquo;re sure you will insist on\u000afinding the cache without the aid of the hints. Good luck! Just be\u000aaware that the cache container is extremely small and there are\u000aloads of places where it could be hidden. Oh, and don&rsquo;t look\u000aat the cache&rsquo;s Gallery until after you&rsquo;ve found\u000ait!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aIf you&rsquo;re the sort of cacher who enjoys the thrill of finding\u000aa cache, though without having to spend hours and hours searching\u000afor it (and we place ourselves firmly in this camp)... the hints\u000awill help you locate the container, though stop short of telling\u000ayou precisely where it is. Well, there&rsquo;s got to be a little\u000abit of a challenge, hasn&rsquo;t there?!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease be aware that whilst the cache seems to be available for\u000amost of the winter, the City puts up barriers that prevent access\u000aafter heavy snowfalls.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b>Sorry for the full log. I'm afraid we're in the UK at the\u000amoment, and won't be back home until the end of February (2010).\u000aAnyone who finds this cache in the meantime can post a photo as\u000aproof of their visit.</b><br />\u000a<br />

Not to put that\u000alovely little hamlet down, but Kingston can boast a few such gems\u000aof its own. Each unique and interesting in its own way; rich in\u000aart, architecture and history. I chose a few, within easy walking\u000adistance of downtown Kingston. There are many more nearby which you\u000amay wish to visit. It may be very interesting to learn more about\u000aKingston churches from the web. The stories and names read like a\u000ahistory of Upper Canada. Don\u2019t cheat yourself out of the full\u000aexperience by rushing through this tour. Stop long enough to take\u000ain such notables as the oldest churchyard cemetery in the district,\u000aor the canon that helped protect Protestantism in Britain.\u000aCertainly enjoy the sights, sounds, ambiance, and the many and\u000avaried other buildings in the Limestone City.</p>\u000a<p>THE TOUR</p>\u000a<p>You will visit 12 churches, all within about a km of the\u000adowntown core. At each, you will gather information (readily\u000aaccessed from the sidewalk) to be used to determine the location of\u000athe next church. The 13th stop is the final cache containing log\u000asheet and pencil. It is hidden a couple m from a roadway, across\u000aflat lawn, in the boughs of an evergreen tree, at waist height. The\u000acomplete 2¾ km tour is arranged to minimize distance.</p>\u000a<p>THE LOCATIONS</p>\u000a<p>Church 1:<br />\u000aAt the cornerstone (the posted coordinates) find the year the\u000achurch was erected (not the year enlarged).<br />\u000aSubtract 1801 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1774 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the posted north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the posted west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 2.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 2:<br />\u000aAt the base of the flagpole find the year the flagpole was\u000adonated.<br />\u000aSubtract 1916 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1885 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 2 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 2 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 3.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 3:<br />\u000aOn the wall above the arched main doorway, find the four-digit date\u000a(in two parts).<br />\u000aSubtract 1700 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1874 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 3 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 3 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 4.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 4:<br />\u000aFind the year above the main door.<br />\u000aSubtract 1810 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1617 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aAdd n to the Church 4 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 4 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 5.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 5:<br />\u000aFind the year in the stained glass above the main door.<br />\u000a Subtract 1838 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1842 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000a*Subtract n from the Church 5 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 5 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 6.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 6:<br />\u000aAt the bottom of the clock tower find the year the church was\u000aoriginally built.<br />\u000aSubtract 1720 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1668 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 6 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 6 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 7.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 7:<br />\u000aFind the year on the painted sign on the front lawn.<br />\u000a Subtract 1856 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1754 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 7 north coordinates.<br />\u000a Subtract w from the Church 7 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 8.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 8:<br />\u000aOn the grey stone slab on the front lawn, find the earliest date\u000a(when the church began to be erected).<br />\u000aSubtract 1823 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1724 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 8 north coordinates.<br />\u000aSubtract w from the Church 8 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 9.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 9:<br />\u000aOn the cornerstone near the front door, find the year.<br />\u000aSubtract 1875 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1904 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 9 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 9 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 10.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 10:<br />\u000aFind the 2-digit brass number on the wall near the wheelchair\u000aaccess door.<br />\u000aSubtract 25 from this number to get n.<br />\u000a*Add 96 to this number to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 10 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 10 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 11.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 11:<br />\u000aOn the cornerstone above the main door, choose the earlier of the\u000atwo dates shown.<br />\u000aSubtract 1765 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1812 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 11 north coordinates.<br />\u000aAdd w to the Church 11 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of Church 12.)</p>\u000a<p>Church 12:<br />\u000aOn the stone monolith, on the lawn, find the year of the original\u000astructure.<br />\u000aSubtract 1666 from this date to get n.<br />\u000aSubtract 1642 from this same date to get w.<br />\u000aSubtract n from the Church 12 north coordinates.<br />\u000aSubtract w from the Church 12 west coordinates.<br />\u000a(These are the coordinates of the Final Cache.)</p>\u000a<p>Please be stealthy and replace exactly as found.

VWelcome to a Parks Canada Earthcache. Earthcaches are located at\u000aspecial geological or geomorphological features. There are no\u000alogbooks, no Tupperware containers, and no trade items at an\u000aEarthCache\u2026just a cool lesson in natural sciences, waiting to be\u000alearned and passed along. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe only constant thing in nature is change. Given enough time,\u000anothing stays the same. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aWetlands are areas that are covered in water for at least part of\u000athe year. There are several types of wetlands, which include:\u000aponds, marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. Ponds have a well-defined\u000ashoreline and are dominated by aquatic plants (\u201csea weeds\u201d) and\u000afloating vegetation (such as lilies). Marshes have open water that\u000ais either standing or slow-moving and are dominated by emergent\u000avegetation, such as cattails and rushes. Swamps are basically a\u000aflooded forest and are dominated by trees. Bogs have very little\u000aopen water, are dominated by mosses, and the ground is actually\u000apeat (compressed and semi-rotten plant material), which acts as a\u000agiant water sponge. Lastly there are fens, which are very similar\u000ato bogs, except that they have a greater variety of plants, and are\u000adominated by sedges and hardy grasses. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aRegardless of what you call them, wetlands are vital to the health\u000aof many larger ecosystems and are often very high in biodiversity\u000a(the number of different species in an area). One of the important\u000aroles wetlands play is as a filter. For example, the plants in a\u000apond slow the flow of the stream that feeds it, especially after\u000astorms and spring thaw. When the stream slows down, it can\u2019t carry\u000aas much sediment and these bits of soil, stone, and other materials\u000athen collect along the bottom of the pond. All these sediments\u000acontain lots of nutrients for many different types of plants. As\u000apond plants die, they add to the layers at the bottom of the pond.\u000aOver time, all that plant material and sediment from the river or\u000astream builds up and the pond becomes very shallow. Eventually,\u000athere is no open water left and what was a pond becomes a meadow.\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aHistorically, wetlands have had been undervalued by people. The\u000asoils are rich, but are waterlogged, so wetlands have been drained\u000ato make room for fields and farms. In many places, wetlands have\u000abeen filled in to build houses, office buildings, and factories.\u000aPollution carried by streams and rivers has settled in wetlands,\u000aimpacting their health.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFortunately, people are finally beginning to understand how\u000aimportant wetlands are to the health of the greater ecosystem. Many\u000apeople are now working together to help protect wetlands and all\u000athe plants and animals that depend on them, including humans.\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aTo log this EarthCache, determine which of the 5 wetland types you\u000acan see in the picture below (of the wetland many years ago) and at\u000athe site and tell me how you came to those conclusions. Email me at\u000aont-sli@pc.gc.ca with your answers and a picture of you at the\u000asite. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<p align="center">\u000a&nbsp;<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/80afe0e1-4929-4dc6-bac7-bba9358841c8.jpg"\u000a     width="576" height="432" /></p>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aBienvenue dans une géocachette de Parcs Canada! Les géocachettes\u000asont situées dans des caractéristiques géologiques,\u000agéomorphologiques ou écologiques spéciales. On n\u2019y trouve pas de\u000acarnet, ni de plat Tupperware, ni d\u2019objet à échanger\u2026 seulement une\u000aleçon branchée sur les sciences naturelles qui attend que vous la\u000adécouvriez et la transmettiez. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aDans la nature, le changement est la seule constante. Tout évolue à\u000ason propre rythme. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aLes milieux humides sont des surfaces couvertes d\u2019eau pendant au\u000amoins une partie de l\u2019année. Il existe plusieurs types de milieux\u000ahumides : les étangs, les marais, les marécages, les tourbières\u000ahautes et les tourbières basses. Les étangs possèdent un rivage\u000abien défini. Les plantes aquatiques (« plantes marines ») et la\u000avégétation flottante (comme les nénuphars) y dominent. Les marais\u000asont situés dans des eaux libres stagnantes ou à débit très lent.\u000aLa végétation émergente (comme les quenouilles et les joncs) y est\u000adominante. Les marécages sont en fait des forêts inondées où les\u000aarbres dominent. Les tourbières ombrotrophes (bogs) ont très peu\u000ad\u2019eaux libres. On y trouve surtout de la mousse poussant sur un\u000aterrain constitué de tourbe (un matériau végétal comprimé et à demi\u000adécomposé) qui agit à la façon d\u2019une éponge géante. Enfin, les\u000atourbières minérotrophes (fens) sont très semblables aux tourbières\u000aombrotrophes, mais on y trouve une plus grande variété de plantes\u000aparmi lesquelles les carex et les graminées rustiques\u000adominent.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a Peu importe leur type, les milieux humides sont essentiels à la\u000asanté de nombreux grands écosystèmes et sont souvent riches en\u000abiodiversité (c\u2019est-à-dire qu\u2019ils abritent de nombreuses espèces\u000adifférentes). L\u2019un des rôles les plus importants des milieux\u000ahumides est de servir de filtre : par exemple, les plantes d\u2019un\u000aétang ralentissent le débit du ruisseau qui l\u2019alimente, surtout\u000aaprès un orage ou lors du dégel printanier. Lorsque le débit est\u000aralenti, la quantité de sédiments transportés est moins grande, et\u000ales débris de sol, de pierres et d\u2019autres matières se déposent au\u000afond de l\u2019étang. Tous ces sédiments contiennent de nombreux\u000anutriments utiles à différentes plantes. Au fur et à mesure que les\u000avégétaux de l\u2019étang meurent, ils s\u2019ajoutent aux couches qui forment\u000ale fond de l\u2019étang. Au fil du temps, toutes les matières végétales\u000aet les sédiments apportés par la rivière ou le ruisseau\u000as\u2019accumulent et l\u2019étang devient de moins en moins profond, jusqu\u2019à\u000ace qu\u2019un jour il ne reste plus d\u2019eau; l\u2019étang devient alors un\u000apré.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a Le rôle des milieux humides a longtemps été sous-estimé. Leur sol\u000ariche, mais saturé d\u2019eau, était souvent drainé pour permettre\u000al\u2019agriculture et la construction de fermes. À de nombreux endroits,\u000aon les a remblayés pour construire des maisons, des immeubles à\u000abureaux et des usines. La pollution transportée par les cours d\u2019eau\u000aet les rivières s\u2019est établie dans les milieux humides, mettant en\u000apéril leur santé. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aHeureusement, on commence à comprendre leur importance pour la\u000asanté des grands écosystèmes. De nos jours, de nombreuses personnes\u000acollaborent pour assurer leur protection ainsi que celle de tous\u000ales organismes vivants qui en dépendent, y compris les êtres\u000ahumains.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPour enregistrer cette géocachette, déterminez lequel des cinq\u000atypes de milieu humide vous voyez dans l'image ici (le milieu\u000ahumide, il y a quelques années) et sur le site et dites-moi comment\u000avous êtes arrivé à cette conclusion.

VWelcome to a Parks Canada Earthcache. Earthcaches are located at special geological or geomorphological features. There are no logbooks, no Tupperware containers, and no trade items at an EarthCache\u2026just a cool lesson in natural sciences, waiting to be learned and passed along.\u000a\u000aTime is a relative construct. To you and me, a decade is a long time. For these rocks, time is measured in hundreds and millions of years. The rock here is a mix of igneous and metamorphic rocks common throughout the Frontenac Axis, a branch of the Canadian Shield. These rocks were formed and shaped deep in the roots of the mountains that once stood here a billion years ago. Since then, erosion has worn away the towering mountain chain that once stood higher than the Rockies do today, over 5,000 metres. As the rocks initially cooled, and then as the weight above them gradually disappeared, fractures called joints appeared. Here the joints lie in an east-west and north-south pattern.\u000a\u000aIce, in the form of the Wisconsin Ice Sheet, polished and plucked the local bedrock into numerous tear-drop shaped hills and outcroppings, known as roche moutonnées, seen among the islands and hills of this area of the Axis. As the ice moved across the highly variable rock formations, with its gritty, rock-laden bottom, it gouged out grooves and troughs in the softer rocks and polished the harder more resistant ones. Typically, as the ice oozed over a resistant rock ridge, it polished the \u2018up-stream\u2019 side (the north-east side) and plucked or pulled away chunks of rock from the down-stream side (south-west). Here, the local jointing pattern of north-south and east-west caused the rocks to break off more parallel to the flow of the ice.\u000a\u000aLastly, around 10,000 years ago, the ice started to melt away. The ice front that had taken many tens of thousands of years to advance was melting back faster than its glacial ice was flowing forward. Enormous meltwater lakes were forming along the southern edge of the retreating ice sheet. The Lake Ontario basin was much fuller and deeper than it is now, and is referred to as Lake Iroquois. Meltwater was saturated with glacial sediments of abrasive rock and as it surged down a maze of streams along the edge of the ice, it eroded the cliffs and rocky stretches of the shoreline. \u000a\u000aHere a section of softer rock that formed a billion years ago in the heart of a mountain, exposed over hundreds of millions of years of erosion and shaped by glacial flow, was finally given its finishing touch of smoothing and polishing by fast flowing water a mere 10,000 years ago. We can stand high and dry beside this very unique linear feature, a side-wise trough, which shows the marks of processes that occurred long ago.\u000a\u000aTo log this EarthCache, note how the different sections of the rock host many different types of plants, mosses, and lichens and describe at least 4 (name them if you can). Email me at ont-sli@pc.gc.ca with your answers and a picture of you at the "rock wave". \u000a\u000aBienvenue dans une géocachette de Parcs Canada! Les géocachettes sont situées dans des caractéristiques géologiques ou géomorphologiques spéciales. On n\u2019y trouve pas de carnet, ni de plat Tupperware, ni d\u2019objet à échanger\u2026 seulement une leçon branchée sur les sciences naturelles qui attend que vous la découvriez et la transmettiez.\u000a\u000aLe temps est un concept relatif. Pour vous et moi, une décennie, c\u2019est long. Pour ces rochers, le temps se compte en centaines et en millions d\u2019années. \u000a\u000aOn trouve ici un mélange de roches ignées et métamorphiques propre à l\u2019axe de Frontenac, une section du Bouclier canadien. Elles se sont formées à une grande profondeur sous des montagnes qui se trouvaient à cet endroit il y a un milliard d\u2019années. Depuis ce temps, l\u2019érosion a rongé l\u2019imposante chaîne de montagne qui s\u2019élevait autrefois à une hauteur plus élevée que celle des Rocheuses actuelles (plus de 5000 mètres). Les roches se sont refroidies et le poids qu\u2019elles supportaient a progressivement disparu, créant des fractures, appelées joints. Ces joints ont adopté une structure formée de deux axes : un axe est-ouest et un axe nord-sud. \u000a\u000aLa glace de la calotte glaciaire du Wisconsin a poli et sculpté le substrat rocheux, y laissant de nombreuses collines en forme de larmes et des affleurements, connus sous le nom de « roches moutonnées », que l\u2019on retrouve sur les îles et les collines de cette région de l\u2019axe. La glace s\u2019est déplacée à travers les formations rocheuses changeantes; son fond graveleux, chargé de roches, a façonné des cannelures et des fossés tectoniques dans les roches tendres et a poli les roches résistantes. Habituellement, lorsque la glace se déplaçait sur une crête résistante, elle polissait le versant « en amont » (versant nord-est) et arrachait des fragments rocheux sur le versant « en aval » (versant sud-ouest). Ici, en raison de la jonction de l\u2019axe nord-sud et de l\u2019axe est-ouest, les roches se sont détachées parallèlement à l\u2019écoulement glaciaire. \u000a\u000aEnfin, il y a environ 10 000 ans, la glace a commencé à fondre. Le front glaciaire, dont l\u2019avancée avait nécessité plusieurs dizaines de milliers d\u2019années, a fondu à un rythme plus rapide que celui de l\u2019écoulement du glacier. D\u2019énormes lacs d\u2019eau de fonte se sont formés le long de la frontière sud de la calotte glaciaire qui se retirait. Le bassin du lac Ontario était beaucoup plus rempli et profond qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui \u2013 on désigne aujourd\u2019hui cet ancien lac par le nom de lac Iroquois. L\u2019eau de fonte était saturée de sédiments glaciaires composés de roches d\u2019érosion et, alors qu\u2019elle s\u2019écoulait en un labyrinthe de cours d\u2019eau le long de la frontière de la calotte glaciaire, elle érodait les falaises et les passages rocheux du littoral.\u000a\u000aUne section de roches tendres formées il y a un milliard d\u2019années au c\u0153ur de la montagne, qui ont été exposées pendant plusieurs centaines de millions d\u2019années à l\u2019érosion et façonnées par l\u2019écoulement glaciaire, a finalement reçu sa touche de finition et de polissage par l\u2019eau en mouvement il y a seulement 10 000 ans. Nous pouvons, bien au sec, observer cette caractéristique linéaire vraiment unique, un fossé tectonique latéral, témoignant de processus très anciens.\u000a\u000aPour enregistrer cette géocachette, notez les divers types de plantes, de mousses et de lichens qu\u2019abritent les différentes sections des roches, en plus d\u2019en décrire au moins quatre (nommez-les si vous le pouvez). Envoyez-moi un courriel à ont-sli@pc.gc.ca avec vos réponses et une photo de vous sur les lieux. >.

VHarold Town was an extremely recognized and honoured artist in his time, however the average person might not know who he was! The location of the cache will reveal all. His studio was in the building that you see, right by the subway tracks, if you are travelling between Yorkville Geo-walk #1 and 2. \u000aThe location rates 3.5 on a Muggle scale of 5. Stealth is key.\u000a\u000aPark as per my notes on Yorkville Geo-walk #1, or at Canadian Tire (that's a big spoiler) if you plan to shop too.\u000a\u000aPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not leave anything, however small, in the cache. There's only room for the log.\u000a\u000aPLEASE NOTE: There is lots of building interference in this area. Coords here are hit and miss, as I read logs. Sometimes spot on, sometimes not. The park sign is HIGHLY visible to lead you to the 'right' side... and the clue says it all. So don't let the GPSr take you across towards the car wash!

VIt is easy to access satellite imagery on the web.  This access provides great benefits to geocaching, and the public at large.  The discipline that is dedicated to the processing of satellite images is known as Remote Sensing.  The cache is not at the listed coordinates, they are for the  Remote Sensing laboratory at the Royal Military College of Canada.\u000a\u000aThe images that you can download from the Internet are usually in a \u201ctrue colour\u201d format.  This means that the image has been modified to emulate a colour photograph.  The general public is used to viewing a true colour image, thus it is an ideal product for web dissemination.  However, a true colour image holds little benefit for a professional analyst.  Earth observation satellites are capable of scanning outside of the EM spectrum, beyond visible range; the portion of the spectrum that yields the most information for a Remote Sensor.\u000a\u000aTo find the cache you will have to do some remote sensing research on the Internet, some analysis of typical RS images, and some legwork.\u000a\u000a\u000aImage 1-Thermal\u000aThis is a thermal image of Kingston.  In this image; bright areas indicate ground that is relatively warmer then other areas in the image.  You must figure out what is happening at the bright white line indicated by the cross-hair and circle.  The answer is one word.  Spell out the word and then convert it to numbers using the phone pad.   The number that you get is \u2018A\u2019. \u000a\u000aImage 2 a and b-Unsupervised Classification\u000aThese images of Kingston are a standard product of remote sensing.  They are a pseudo-colour image produced by statistically grouping similar spectral signatures.  Each colour represents a distinctive landcover.  Travel to the location indicated by the cross-hair and circle, in the middle of the red box.  The red pixels indicate that this object is spectrally different than its surroundings.  Also, the object is not square, the pixels are arranged in a grid and the red ones are the ones that cover the object.  Read the large 3 digit number on one side of the object.  This number is data \u2018B\u2019.\u000a\u000aInternet\u000aCanada is a leader in one type of satellite remote sensing.  The second model of this satellite type was launched successfully into space aboard a Soyuz rocket on December 14, 2007.   Find out the generic acronym for the sensor used on this satellite.  Convert to numbers, again using the phone pad, to get \u2018C\u2019.  \u000a\u000a\u000aImages 3a and b NDVI\u000aImage 3 is a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image of a section of Kingston, Ontario.  The NDVI is produced by ratioing together the Red and Near Infrared portions of the spectrum.  The benefit of a NDVI is that it shows vegetation stress; brighter areas indicate healthy vegetation, darker areas indicate stressed or non-vegetated areas.   The image was scanned in the early spring before the trees had their leaves, but the grass was healthy.  Using this knowledge and orienting yourself from landmarks in the image, seek out the source of the dark spot marked by the cross-hair and circle.  Here you will find an object with a yellow letter on it.  Use the phone pad to convert this letter to a number.  Then multiply the number by 100.  The result is \u2018D\u2019.  Visit this location last, as the cache is located in the same area.\u000a\u000aLocation\u000aDisregard the decimal and:\u000a\u000a3684695+A+B=North coordinate   \u000a7635492+C+D=West coordinate    \u000a\u000aCheck the final coordinates here:\u000ahttp://tinyurl.com/km2uh

VThe general area where you find the cache was once a fairly large estate owned by Chief Justice William Draper, who came to Upper Canada in 1820. \u000aHe rose in the ranks to become Chief Justice by 1863. \u000aTake time to read more about Draper on the descriptive panel at the corner of Hazeldean Park. \u000aDon't forget to first visit Memories of Severn Creek Park, the now-official start point of this geo-tour. Use the same parking hints for that cache.\u000aCan you imagine there was a creek flowing where you now see cars heading down Rosedale Valley Road toward Bayview Avenue?\u000aCan you also imagine that there was a bridge crossing the creek to connect Hazeldean with its then-neighbour estate Rosedale?\u000aEven if you live in Toronto I bet you will learn at least 1 thing you never knew before!\u000aThe cache is an economy-size vitamin bottle camod with black tape but the lid is green.\u000aPlease cover it well when you replace it. \u000a\u000aElectroQTed has reported coords at N 43° 40.378 W 079° 23.045, give these a whack and let me know if they continue to be closer. I seem to find the summer canopy has presented me with less precise coords captures than for caches I placed in the spring.

VRoute 113, also known as The Pequawket Trail, runs from the Ossipee Trail on the southern end to the center of Fryeburg.  It is about 30 miles long and has very few caches along it.  I am establishing the Pequawket Trail Cache Bonanza to remedy that situation.   I will place a few caches along the trail to get things going.  Each cache will be designated PTCB Mile # wherein the number represents the over the road miles from the intersection with Ossipee Trail heading North.  For example, if a cache is 5.6 miles from the Ossipee Trail, it would be designated PTCB Mile 5.6.  From thereon it is up to you guys to fill in the rest of the trail.\u000a\u000aYou may place any type of hide that you wish (traditional, multi, puzzle, nano, micro, small, regular or large) however to be part of the Cache Bonanza I would ask that the cache be within ¼ mile of the Pequawket Trail and capable of being done in fifteen minutes or less.  As these caches get filled in, simply follow the naming convention above and copy this information into your description.  If you would like me to e-mail it to you, I can do that.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO TRAIL MONGERS FOR THE FIRST TO FIND!!

VThis is #22 in the series of caches along this rail trail. Some are easy, some are hard, some are winter friendly, some are not. Since the North country is now in the grip of winter we thought it would be a good time to add some winter friendly caches to the trail. The trail has been packed down by the snowmobilers so walking on the trail is easy now. Just be wary of the snowmobilers.

VPark at designated coordinates. Carefully walk to the starting coordinates. You will have to climb over some riff raff to get there. Starting point is identified by a 1" yellow reflector. Once here shine your light down Old Rt #3. You will see a trail of fire tacks. Follow this trail CAREFULLY stepping over downed trees. You may notice a real nice Glacial Erratic standing on its end to your right part way down this trail. Once you cross a small brook that passes under the trail through a culvert you will see two 1" red reflectors surrounded by fire tacks. Here you must shine your lights into the trees along side the trail. HINT...look up!  Once you spotted a  white reflector make your way (climb) to it. Once there, look for an X made out of fire tacks. Cache is close by covered by natural camouflage.

VCache is a small match stick container just hanging out.  Not only was this cache placed on Christmas eve but it is day 42 and cache 42 of my goal to place a cache a day.  This day was very tempting to quit.  It was a really cold blizzard filled evening.  I was drenched and shivering by the time I made it back to the truck after placing and marking the cords for this cache.  I have many fond memories of this area from when I was a teenager.  Enjoy!  :]

VWe really enjoy this River Walk and thought it would be nice if there were more family type caches hidden along it. We believe that these are easy finds, and hope you do too.  It was difficult to get any consistent and accurate readings in all the trees and a cloudy rainy day,  but we checked them several times and did our best . The name is a clue and if you need a little more help because of difficulty of good GPS readings the hint should be of some help.  Enjoy!!!

VThe Little Spokane River rises in southern Pend Oreille County, south of Newport near the Idaho state line. It then flows south/southwest past Milan and Colbert, Washington. It joins with the Spokane River from the east, approximately 10 miles northwest of the City of Spokane.\u000a\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/cache/1227e862-fad1-4c65-89fa-d4a09302f100.jpg alt=""\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNorth of the City of Spokane groundwater in the Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer flows in a northward direction toward the Little Spokane River, following the ancestral channel of the Spokane River. Unconsolidated sediments have filled this channel (referred to as the Hillyard Trough) to a depth of over 700 feet. Several large capacity springs are dispersed over an approximate two mile wide area along the interface between the Hillyard Trough and the Little Spokane River Valley. This area has been recognized as a primary regional discharge zone for the Spokane Valley ' Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. The springs typically discharge 30 to 100 feet above the Little Spokane River, and are fed by groundwater from the Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. Stream flow in the Little Spokane River increases approximately 250 cfs (Cubic feet per second) over this reach of the river, in response to the groundwater discharge.\u000a\u000aThe Spokane Valley / Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer within the Hillyard Trough historically has been described as a single, largely unconfined unit, developed within unconsolidated Quaternary flood deposits. Hydrogeologic investigations and literature review conducted in support of two Spokane area wellhead protection projects have provided evidence of a deep, areally extensive, confined aquifer that extends from the north Hillyard Trough into the lower reaches of the Little Spokane River Valley. This secondary, deeper aquifer is present within the north Hillyard Trough at depths of 300 to 500 feet below ground, and is overlain by 150 to 200 feet of low permeability sediments. These low permeability sediments are typically encountered between elevation 1450 and 1650 FAMSL beneath both the Hillyard Trough and Little Spokane River Valley, and may represent remnants of a glaciolacustrine (lakebed) deposit. Within the Little Spokane River Valley, the deep confined aquifer system is encountered at depths of approximately 100 to 150 feet below the valley floor.\u000a\u000aThis earthcache will bring you to the Little Spokane River where it flows through the Haynes Estate Conservation Area, which is maintained by the Spokane County Parks and Recreation Department. \u000a\u000aYou can reach the Haynes Estate Conservation Area from the east or the west. Coordinates for both entry locations are posted.\u000a\u000aTo receive credit for this Earthcache, you must complete the following 3 requirements.\u000a\u000a1) Upload a picture of yourself at the posted coordinates with the Little Spokane River as your background.  Please also describe any wild life you saw while visiting this earthcache.\u000a\u000a2) Determine the flow rate in "Feet Per Second" for the Little Spokane River.\u000a\u000aThis may be done by measuring & marking a distance along the different river bank, then tossing in a leaf upriver from your starting point. With a stop watch, time how long it takes your leaf to complete your measured distance course. Then calculate that into "Feet Per Second" for the river.\u000a\u000a3) Estimate how deep the river is at the bend and how wide it is at the bend.\u000a\u000aYour picture must be posted with your log entry and your answeres E-MAILED to the cache owner.\u000a\u000aMartin 5\u000aPlatinum Level EarthCache Masters\u000a\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/91a49b5b-b6f4-4895-b270-dd64314a9a63.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/6599a5b8-3f32-456d-9705-eaf131e7aa57.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/4a08d1bf-21b5-4176-a727-2a121ffbf72f.jpg alt=\u201d\u201d\u000a<img src=http://img.geocaching.com/user/bb4abe93-0c11-44e6-b35f-792c2a3d7449.jpg alt=""\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Trev of The Steaks for FTF on this EarthCache on the same day it was published!! \u000a\u000aFor more information about the aquifer see the following earthcache: The Rathdrum Prairie - Spokane Aquifer, by Three Bottles (GC1AA9M).\u000a\u000aFor more information about the Spokane River see the following earthcache: Fort Sherman, by Martin 5 (GC1HGAW).

We left an inspirational notebook,inspirational keychain,a pamphlet called inner compass exercise to help attract wealth , a snowball candle, an issues magazine,a meditation cd,(very nice) and a very interesting documentary dvd. our wish is that if you take the dvd that you watch it but pass it on to another cache for others to see. We would also appreciate if you log on as the holder of the dvd you could add a note as to what cache you left it in. Thank you.

VThe area is full of many different trails all leading in the same\u000ageneral area. You may want to take the trail head co-ordinates\u000aprovided, just so you start on the right trail. Look for an exposed\u000awater line on the trail and follow it for a bit eventually taking a\u000atrail to your right. This will take you to the spot which is the\u000areason for the 4.0 difficulty rating. The bridge you will see in\u000afront of you is used for scout training purposes. PLEASE USE\u000aCAUTION! I don't recommend this for little kids. The cache is on\u000athe other side of this bridge.

There is a FTF prize consisting of a $10.00 Canadian Tire gift certificate.\u000a\u000aThe cache contains a log book only so you will need to bring your own pen or pencil to sign it.\u000a\u000aI have increased the difficulty rating to 3.5 and have decided not to give another clue just yet. I have checked the co-ords several times and have gotten slightly different readings, but overall, the co-ords are fairly accurate. \u000a\u000aStealth may be required at times so please keep an eye out for muggles. \u000a\u000aHappy Geocaching and Good Luck!!!

VThe LeRoi Gold Mine Tour is the only tour like it in all of Canada. The tour takes you undergroumd into what was once a working mine shaft and see how mining was done in the early 1900\u2019s. The tours are open May1st- Sept 1st each year. Tours go every hour and a half  through the day starting at 9:30 am with the last tour leaving at 3:30pm sharp. The constant underground temperature is 55 F, which is quite refreshing on a really hot day, but if you get cold easy you may want to bring along a jacket or take one of the blankets provided. Although to get credit for this cache you do not need to take the tour, I highly recommend the tour to people of all ages. Kids love to try to pan for GOLD after the tour is over. \u000a\u000aLeRoi Gold Mine History:\u000aIn the 1890\u2019s \u000aThe LeRoi mine was one of five claims staked on Red Mountain. It was bought for $12.50 and eventually was sold for 3 million dollars. The LeRoi mine became the most famous of the five claims and produced almost 30 million dollars. In 1911 the five original mines were consolidated and bought by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company later known as Cominco. Cominco later changed there name to Teck Cominco and as of June 1st, 2009 will be known only as Teck.\u000a \u000aHow Gold is formed:\u000a\u000aGold is formed as the result of molten rock, called magma, being intruded into solid rock.  As the magma cools and solidifies, water and other volatile substances separate out from the magma under high pressure.  The high pressure of hot water and steam force open fissures in the surrounding solid rock, through which these hydrothermal solutions travel.  When the hydrothermal solutions cool, deposition of material occurs, especially quartz in the form of quartz veins. Because gold has a relatively low melting temperature, it is sometimes carried by these hydrothermal solutions through the fissures in the rock and solidifies inside the quartz veins.  Thus, the place to look for gold is usually in quartz veins near the intrusion of a magma body. The city of Rossland is situated in the heart of an ancient volcano. This volcano is the reason why Rossland is so full of gold. If these quartz veins are eroded by the earths cycles, the gold may be found in streams and rivers; this explains why prospectors were able to pan for gold. Try your luck at panning for gold after the tour!\u000a\u000aTo get credit for this cache you must do three things:\u000a1. Take a picture of you or your GPS at the Leroi Gold Mine sign or somewhere on the property. If  you take the tour please include a picture of you underground. \u000a2. Answer these questions, how many flag poles are there in a row? Please email me your answer.\u000a3. How much ore was taken out of the mines in Rossland and how much was it worth? (Read signs)

V<p>Peterson Creek winds it's way down from the highlands, and has\u000acarved deep gullies through it's journey to the Thompson River.</p>\u000a<p>The geography of this City Park is beautiful and one of the best\u000aways to appreciate this beauty is to follow the creek bed. As a kid\u000agrowing up in this area, I hiked from the top Bridal Veil Falls to\u000athe reservoir and the Upper Falls and back down many times... this\u000ais a challenging venture that requires some scrambling and route\u000afinding. The really beautiful parts of the creek are only\u000aaccessible this way. Boots are recommended simply because sometimes\u000athe only way to move ahead is through the creek.</p>\u000a<p>There are 2 recommended entrances... the upper Summit Entrance,\u000aand the Whiteshield entrance. From each one, make your way down to\u000athe creek, and head south along the creek bed. If the Summit\u000aEntrance is taken, 2 choices can be made... walking along the\u000atrails to the reservoir, and then following the creek down (N), or\u000awalking away from the cache, taking the trail down to the creek and\u000athen following the creek up (S). Either way, cachers are\u000a<b>STRONGLY DISCOURAGED</b> from going straight down to the cache\u000afrom the trail.</p>\u000a<p>There are cliff bands above the cache, and the bank erodes\u000aeasily. A misstep is extremely likely, and I would hate to see\u000asomeone hurt. I walk the upper trail quite a bit, if I see signs of\u000acachers coming in from the top, I will pull the cache in the\u000ainterest of safety. Beware of Ticks in season(Spring), and Bears in\u000aseason(Fall). Last fall I ran into a Mama and 2 cubs down on the\u000acreek... neat experience, but a little too close. There are thorny\u000athings down there, and I have seen Poison Ivy in the park, but none\u000adown by the creek. Watch for falling rock from above.</p>\u000a<p>After all of the above warnings, I know that some of your are\u000asalivating to go (I know I would be). Enjoy your hike along the\u000acreek bed. Be careful, wear good boots and go with someone\u000aelse.</p>\u000a<center>TO<br />\u000a<a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/index.php?name=Blitz&amp;op=vote&amp;gcid=GC1QA8C">\u000a<img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/pics/vote7.jpg" /></a></center>

VI was traveling back from Kelowna with a group of Scouters and said that I always thought this rest area should have a cache. And so the idea was born. We had a cache box in the car that need a place to be put. It is a great area. When the kids were little we stopped here often for a run through the trees. \u000aThe cache is a small camo lock 'n lock with all sorts of odds and sods in it. Everyone contributed something.

VJust a small cache to commemorate our daughter's first birthday.\u000aIt's been a fun year learning about being a parent. For those of\u000ayou with kids, you'll know of what we speak. For those of you\u000awithout kids, we're sure you can appreciate the changes offspring\u000abring. Our gift to you, the cacher, is a nice view of Rossland, Red\u000aMountain, and the surrounding area. And of course some trade items.\u000a\u000a<p>The cache is located just past the 1 km marker along the Malde\u000aCreek forest service road. There are a few options for parking near\u000athe cache, mainly on the wide switchback sections of the road. At\u000athe time of placing, the road was rough, but easily passable in a\u000ahigher clearance 2wd vehicle. If you would like instructions on how\u000abest to drive to this location, please e-mail me, I'd be glad to\u000aassist.</p>\u000a<p>Once near the cache, look for easy ways to access it. There is\u000ano need to risk life and limb or do any climbing. There is a\u000arelatively easy way to get to where you need to be. Just watch your\u000alittle ones around the cache. Enjoy the view!</p>\u000a<p>There is a prize for first to find.</p>\u000a<center>KR<br />\u000a<a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/index.php?name=Blitz&amp;op=vote&amp;gcid=GC1R54Y">\u000a<img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/pics/vote7.jpg" /></a></center>

VDO NOT LEAVE ANY TRACKABLES IN THIS CACHE. THE MUGGLES WILL GET THEM!\u000a\u000a\u000aThis cache is at the old smelter tower in Greenwood / Anaconda. Terrain and difficulty are both mild. Cache container is a plastic Mayo-style jar. Coordinates on this one aren't the best, but keep in mind the terrain rating and it should be easy.

VThe most noticeable thing about Greenwood as you drive into town is the Huge Slag Pile and imposing Smokestack.  The smelter was built by the British Columbia Copper Company, a New York-based organization that bought the Mother Lode mine in 1898.  The smelter was erected on a 28-hectare site at the mouth of Copper Creek (now called Mother Lode Creek) in the town of Anaconda, just south of Greenwood.  The smokestack itself towers in at 36m (121ft) high.\u000a\u000aFebruary 18, 1901 marked the blowing in of the first furnace.  The smelter was open 24 hours a day and employing 47 men during the first year.  That year 106000 tonnes of ore was smelted.  On January 18, 1902 a record amount , 416 tonnes, (about 9 tonnes for every man employed, were smelted.  the smelter operated very successfully until 1912 when shortages of ore began to affect production.  Throughout World War l the smelter worked intermittently at a reduced rate and on November 26, 1918 closed forever.  the plant was sold to Leon Lotzkar who disposed of the machinery and later gave the site to the City of Greenwood as a park.\u000a\u000aThe smelter was originally built with a sheet steel smokestack that was replaced by the present brick stack when the works were expanded in 1904.\u000a\u000aTurn off the highway at the ice cream shop (Washington St) and go over the small bridge.  The street sign for Smelter (rd?) is now missing, but the pole is still quite visible. The road is in pretty good shape, and can be done in most any vehicle. Or you can just park at the crossroad and walk up; it's not very far.\u000a\u000aIf you decide to walk down the hill there are significant ruins still in place, but use caution, as there are open holes and many of the tunnels are half collapsed. I wouldn't recommend entering any tunnels.

VThis multi-cache traces the Centennial Trail from its trailhead in\u000aRossland to Red Resort (almost). The trail is 2.7 km long\u000a(one-way). Either you'll have to have a car at both ends or walk\u000aback - I suggest the walk. [An alternate route back to the\u000atrailhead will take you past\u000a<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=56223028-145a-454f-85a0-6020165929be">\u000aScary Larry's</a>] The trail is wide, mostly level, and very\u000awell-travelled.<br />\u000aEach stage of this cache is only a few metres off-trail.<br />\u000a <br />\u000aThis cache was placed in the winter. Snowshoes will get you<br />\u000aright to each cache. If you're on skis or walking in boots you\u000amay<br />\u000ahave more fun with the off-trail part, either due to sinking\u000ainto<br />\u000athe snow or difficulty maneuvering around trees. Regardless of\u000ahow<br />\u000ayou travel, the caches are fully accessible in winter.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<p>There is some tree-cover at all cache locations, but\u000areception<br />\u000awas not bad when I was hiding these caches.</p>\u000aAll 3 stages of this cache are hidden in the same manner, so\u000aonce<br />\u000ayou find the first one you'll know what you`re looking for.\u000aThey're<br />\u000aall camo-d the lazy man's way - camo tape.<br />\u000a<p>The first 2 stages of this cache are quite small. Each one\u000awill<br />\u000agive you the coordinates of the next stage. The final cache\u000ais<br />\u000alarger - more like a regular-sized cache.</p>\u000a<br />\u000a<p>Since this cache was hidden in winter, original contents\u000awere<br />\u000aitems that might be useful to an cacher who came out unprepared\u000afor<br />\u000awinter (not that any of you would do that!).</p>\u000a<br />\u000a<p>Enjoy!</p>

V<font face="comic sans ms" color="green" size="4">Humphrey and the\u000aDumptrucks</font> were a country-folk band active from 1967-1981.\u000aIt was originally organized in Saskatoon by Gary "Humphrey\u000aDumptruck" Walsh (banjo, dobro) as a jugband. By 1969 they were a\u000afiull-time professional band, playing across Western Canada, on\u000aCBC, at festivals, and at schools and universities. At one point\u000athey collaborated with a playwright to produce a country musical\u000acalled Cruel Tears, roughly based on Othello. It toured Canada and\u000aplayed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Six albums still are\u000aavailable, though mostly through special orders.

VRobbins Range School was begun in 1915 and was opened in 1916 with\u000aMiss Helen Harrold as the first teacher. The school also served as\u000aa community center for church services, picnics, dances, for\u000adecades, Christmas concerts, and special celebrations. After WWII,\u000athe school population dwindled until it finally closed in 1952.\u000a<br />\u000aThe school building was dismantled and reconstructed onto the\u000aPineridge School site during the summer of 1985, using a grant from\u000aCanada Works, and support from the Phi Delta Kappa organization and\u000aSchool District #24 (now #73).<br />\u000aIt was officially opened on May Day commemorating 100 years of\u000apublic schooling in Kamloops. <br />\u000aThe school is opened up for a few months each spring for classroom\u000avisits and a day of heritage. This may not be a suitable cache for\u000aregular school hours. Please attempt this cache after 4:00 or\u000aduring weekends. The cache was originally placed right at the\u000aschool, but was moved to a spot withing easy walking distance, and\u000aoff school property.

Originally called the "Dublin Gulch" in the\u000avery early days, it eventually became known as "The Gulch" as it\u000afilled up with Italians who chose not to live on the original Trail\u000atown site. The Gulch starts as throat of Trail Creek narrows\u000abetween the high, sandy slope of Smelter Hill on its left bank and\u000athe West Trail bank where early pioneer houses were built by\u000aimmigrants as the purchased properties along the west bank steep\u000aterrain.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aYou are looking for something quite small. Bring a pencil.<br />\u000a<font color="blue">This is a wheelchair accessible\u000acache.</font><br />

VThis is the place to share that guilty caching secret you have\u2026 you\u000aknow, the one that's eating you up inside. <br />\u000aPerhaps you've called in sick to work in order to go caching, maybe\u000ayou've been late to a wedding because you just couldn't find that\u000aevil micro, maybe you've gone out and found a cache behind your\u000acaching partner's back or logged a cache you've never actually\u000afound. <br />\u000aThere's no secret too big or too small, it all fits in "The Cache\u000aConfessional". <br />\u000aWhile you can only log a find once, you can log a visit as often as\u000ayou like. <br />\u000a <br />\u000aAnd if you wish to remain anonymous, you can email your confessions\u000ato me and I will anonymously post them for you. <br />\u000a <br />\u000aSeek absolution.

Many of the trees have now been cut down and there are signs of burning all around from work crews geting rid of the dead wood.\u000a\u000aThe cache is about 20 meters off the trail and should be accessible by most children and dogs. The container is a small lock n lock with a few trade items, including a Darth Vader Pez dispenser!

VThis cache is hidden in near the Lac le Jeune area. The cache is\u000abig; lots of room for tradeables! It is also hidden near a bunch of\u000ayellow-bellied marmots, but please try not to disturb them. The\u000acache is not hidden in a hole so people don't disrupt their\u000aburrows. <br>\u000a<br>\u000aThe Yellow-bellied Marmot, AKA the Rock Chuck, is a ground squirrel\u000ain the marmot genus. It lives in the western United States and\u000asouthwestern Canada. It inhabits steppes, meadows, talus fields and\u000aother open habitats, sometimes on the edge of deciduous or\u000aconiferous forests, and typically above 2000 metres of elevation.\u000aYellow-bellied Marmots usually weigh between 5 and 11 pounds when\u000afully grown. They get fatter in the fall just before hibernating. A\u000amarmot's habitat is mostly grass and rocks with few trees. When a\u000amarmot sees a predator, it whistles to warn all other marmots in\u000athe area (giving it the nickname the whistle pig).<br>\u000a <br>\u000aMarmots reproduce when about 2 years old, and may live up to an age\u000aof 15 years. They reside in colonies, a group of 10-20. The marmot\u000ais an omnivore, eating grass, leaves, flowers, fruit, grasshoppers,\u000aand bird eggs.<br>\u000a<br>\u000a(Wikipedia)<br>\u000a<br>\u000aTO<br>\u000a<a href=\u000a"http://www.bcgeocaching.com/index.php?name=Blitz&amp;op=vote&amp;gcid=YOUR_GC_ID_HERE">\u000a<br>\u000a<img src=\u000a"http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/pics/vote6.jpg"><br></a>\u000a<p><br>\u000a</p>

VThis cache is on Reserve lands and I have not asked for permission\u000aand I doubt it would be given. Nevertheless, hikers have used this\u000atrail for 20 years and I have never heard of any problems. Use your\u000aown judgment;if you choose this cache, but please respect the land\u000aand go quietly. If you have any problems, contact me and I will\u000awithdraw the cache.The mountain bike and hiking community call this\u000atrail the Moonscape Trail because of its bleak, eroded terrain. Few\u000atrees, but lots of sage, bunch grass, and prickly pear cactus. A\u000alarge but remote area near the city, it gets few visitors. Access\u000afrom the east or west is possible. Use Google Earth or Google maps\u000ato see the trail which traverses the whole area and takes you close\u000ato the cache. From the west, hikers or mountain bikers can start at\u000aN 50 41.983, W 120 16.983 or a higher access can be used from the\u000atop NE end of the golf course. Either way, the fence crossing is at\u000aN 50 41.590 W 120 16.924. From there it is just a hike on pleasant\u000atrail. The target is a lock n lock box with the usual materials.\u000athis is a good trail for hikers, especially early or late in the\u000aseasons. Not a good winter cache. Good luck. \u000a<!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#669966" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/roundlogo-green5.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VShumway Lake is a long narrow alkali lake next to Highway 5A\u000abetween Kamloops and the Nicola Lake area. It certainly is not a\u000adestination in itself, but it is the home to a number of water\u000asports in the region. First commissioned for rowing, canoeing, and\u000awater skiing competition for the 1993 Canada Summer Games, it has\u000asince become the home for training and competitive paddling for\u000aflatwater sports. A 2000m race course can be seen from the highway,\u000amarked by buoys anchored below the lake. For several weekends in\u000athe summer, local, regional and provincial championships may be\u000astaged at the site. The south end of the lake is also used for\u000awater skiing competitions (jumps and slalom). <br />\u000a<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f668b8c2-8d94-48ac-88e9-5d5b75010abe.jpg" />\u000a <br />\u000a The cache is a lock and lock container, hidden well out of sight.\u000aBe discrete when the area is being used, but most of the time it is\u000aa quiet spot just off the highway.

V1st part of this cache is a micro.  Contains only the co-ordinates for the 2nd (main) cache.  Please be careful retrieving and replacing the micro as this is a very well travelled area and many potential muggles may be about.\u000a\u000a2nd part of cache is a small ammo box containing some trade items and a log book.  No need to go outside the Park boundary to find this one.  It is pretty straightforward.  The clue is for the first cache.  None should be needed for the second.\u000a\u000aYou may want to take your camera.  View from the 2nd cache vicinity is pretty good.

VCache originally was placed by Beavis and titled Duffy's Pub.  Treasure lov'n Tami took over the cache location in May 2008.  Sundemon adopted the cache in 2009.  The location is close to the original placement by Beavis. Extensive tree removal in the area prompted a slight move to a safer location.

VPython Lake lay in a bowl below Coal Hill. It was often full of\u000afrogs, ducks, and shore birds. When the Pineview Valley subdivision\u000awas built, the area was reconfigured to leave a duck pond and\u000acanals winding through the neighborhood. Yellow-winged and\u000ared-winged blackbirds nest here in the spring and the area is a\u000apleasant walking spot all year round.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center><img src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/a09d63f2-3d2c-46bb-b536-34293a846435.jpg" /></center>

VThis is an area of erosion gullies left from the fringes of a\u000aglacial lake that once filled the valley. Where drainage channels\u000ahave found softer sediments, water has drilled vertically\u000adownwards, leaving collapsed landforms and sinkholes. There are\u000aabout 25 sinkholes in this area. The hike follows a series existing\u000atrails to the head of a gully network. Google Earth is a good\u000aresource to sort out routes. <!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#669966" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/roundlogo-green5.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

The whole loop which takes you across both bridges takes about 30 min and has beautiful views of the Columbia River. It\u2019s a very easy walk to the cache location, and you can drive almost right up to it. This is a micro cache so there is no room for trading items, just a log book and pencil. Please replace the log in the exact same spot as this is a VERY popular location for Muggles so stealth is required.

VA persuasive letter to a \u201cpaesano\u201d in Italy about the mining areas of Butte, Montana and California and telling them of the work available in this remote little smelting town situated in the mountains of British Columbia alongside the banks of the Columbia River brought the influx of Italian immigrants to Trail.\u000aThe first to arrive were (people from the provinces of) Toscani followed by Friulani, Abruzzi, Trevisani and Calabrese and today practically every dialect is represented in this City of Italians which is a perfect example of the multiculturalism within our community.  With an ever increasing Italian population plus a language barrier and being in a distant and lonely land there was a necessity to form a Society.\u000aThis came about on April 5, 1905 when 32 founding members banded together to form the Cristoforo Colombo Lodge Mutuo Soccorso No. 1, a benevolent society, whose main purpose was to assist its members in cases of sickness or accident and to provide a decent burial for the deceased members.\u000aThe Colombo Lodge was and still is the heart of the Italian community in Trail.  Without the Society they would have been just another separated ethnic group but they are a unique, united Society with (as of 2005) 550 brothers and 470 members of the Sorelle di Colombo.\u000aThe Piazza Colombo is a tranquil little park situated in the heart of the Italian community of Trail alongside the Colombo Lodge.  It was constructed by over 50 skilled volunteers who put in more than 7500 man hours of labour constructing the park and feeding the workers.\u000aThe grotto in the southwest corner of the Piazza is actually the last remnant of the home of Issaco Georgetti, Trail\u2019s first Italian immigrant.\u000aCome and rest in this attractive little park and think back to the changes that 103 years bring.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a medium size peanut butter jar with the usual logbook and stuff, some small trade items and a small FTF.

VBon Appétit, is a recipe exchange cache.  Mrs. Ferret had this idea, and we all thought it was a keeper.  The cache is in a 6in x 8in Rubbermaid container.  We stocked the cache with 12 of our favourite recipes, on 4 x 6 cards.  There is a first to find prize, clearly marked, and a second to find prize as well. There is room for some small trade items, but the idea was to share other recipe ideas with our fellow cachers.  The growling that you hear is not the residents, it's your bellies.  Enjoy, and have fun.  Oh ya, this is a high muggle area as well. Bon Appétit

This hike is climbing the whole way. You start at 2200 feet and climb to 6900 feet to the very top if you want to see the amazing view Mt.Roberts has to offer.

VThere is a road that a vehicle may go up that will take you part way to the trail head and save you a lot of walking. The road however is not maintained and has a lot of groves and washed out areas, there was also tree`s down in some spots from the recent stormes that are insurpassable by an type of vehicle. Please be warned if you wish to make it to the top where the flag is it is 4 hours from the parking area indicated. This time can be reduced if you can make it part way up in a vehicle. The cache has two parts, the co-ordinates above are the co-ordinates to the first cache. In the first cache are the co-odinates to the second cache. I did not place this cache at the top as I wanted it to be accesible to everyone, even those who dont intend to do the whole hike. Both caches are containers that can hold trade items the first container is a size 2 camoflaged tuperware type. The second is a comoflaged type 3. \u000a\u000aOriginal contents Include:\u000aTrade Items \u000aAn awesome FTF prize \u000alog book \u000aAnd Pencils\u000a\u000aPLEASE ENJOY YOUR HIKE AND THE AMAZING VIEWS MT.ROBERTS HAS TO OFFER.

VThere are about 50 km of trails in the Stake-Lake system and and probably as many in the adjacent Lac le Jeune area.  The area is home to cross-country skiers in the winter and in the summer mountain bikers and hikers use the area.   \u000aThe cache is at the top of a side trail called Rattler Viewpoint.  There are no rattlers in the area, but all the trails have a western theme - Bushwacker, Hold-Up, Cartwheel, Drifter, and so on.  Although this cache is fairly close to the Lac le Jeune Road, a straight route won't work because of a fence, a marsh, and a canyon.  It can be approached from either the Stake Lake parking lot (longer) or from Lac le Jeune Provincial Park.   Park near the gate, proceed north to pick up the trail system (maps are posted at every intersection) and work your way to the trail junction at N50 29.757, W120 28.700.  From there, just follow the trail to the top.  There are good views from the top - Chuwhels Mountain, Stake Lake, McConnell Hill, and the  surrounding hillsides.  There are drop-offs to the west, so be careful there.  The cliffs are actually vertical, faceted basalt columns which you can't see from the top.    There will be a future cache at a lower viewpoint next to the canyon.\u000aThe cache is a small container with room for small items (pin sized) only.

VThe Stake Lake area includes 45 km of ski trails built in 1986 when\u000athe Coquihalla Highway bisected the Bush Lake trail system. The\u000atrails fill the area between Lac le Jeune and McConnell Lake and a\u000anumber of trails round McConnell Hill, a volcanic butte. Three\u000acaches were placed on a circuit around the basalt columns of\u000aMcConnell Hill. A cacher can hike or bike the trails in a circle\u000aroute picking up all three caches. An Amphitheatre takes the cacher\u000ato the north flank of McConnell Hill. The easiest approach is to\u000apark at Stake Lake and use the trail maps to go to the north\u000aapproach up the Sidewinder trail. At N50 31.087, W120 27.223, look\u000afor a side trail to the right. Follow this trail to the\u000aamphitheater. <br />\u000aAfter completing this cache, follow Sidewinder to the top and go on\u000ato Bushwacker South Viewpoint.<br />

The trails fill the area between Lac le Jeune and McConnell Lake and a number of trails round McConnell Hill, a volcanic butte.   Three caches were placed on a circuit around the basalt columns of McConnell Hill.   A cacher can hike or bike the trails in a circle route picking up all three caches.\u000aFollow the Sidewinder trail all the way to the top of McConnell Hill and then veer south onto the Bushwacker trail.   At a junction which is hard to see (N50 30.548, W120 26.873), head west to the viewpoint.  \u000aThe container is a large bright yellow mustard container hidden just past the viewpoint.

VThe items inside the cache are more kid related but not all of it is. The FTF prize IS for a kid. The cache is located at an interesting part of west trail. The best way to access the cache is to park on Milligan Ave at N49 05.707 W117 42.969. There is plenty of room for cars on that street. Once in the park area you will see a very long set of stairs that takes you down to an open field with an old water fountain directly in the middle. This site was once a wadding pool for kids but over time has just grown over. From here you should begin your search. Have fun, trade fair.

VIt\u2019s TRU, our Solar System is changing.\u000a\u000aThis is a 6 part multi cache.  A good walk with a little billy goat part at the end.  There is some road construction coming up in the spring, so hopefully Neptune and Pluto survive.  You may think this is a joke, but I cannot find Uranus.  It may be lost due to construction, but if anyone finds it, let me know and we can add it to the hike.  The first five points have clues to get you to the cache (Ammo container).  Check out the description of the planets to get the #\u2019s needed.  I know Pluto is not a planet, but you know what I mean.  A pen or pencil may help keep track of the clues.  \u000a\u000aFind Earth at 50d40.294, 120d21.836.

VThe main access is via lower Peterson Creek Park. The first cache\u000ais a non-traditional micro in a very dark spot a few metres from\u000athe listed coordinates, but you may find that your GPS will not be\u000avery accurate in this tight location. Use the clues once you are\u000aclose and come prepared for this challenge. The second cache is a\u000asmall lock n lock container with appropriate items. Although both\u000ahides are winter friendly, the route in will be a challenge. Except\u000afor the intrepid, this is a better cache in dry conditions.

VA micro cache in Peterson Creek Park, honoring those that have given their lives protecting us.\u000a\u000aThe cairn near the Cache location was built in Memoriam to the 3 RCMP officers (all under 25) that lost their lives to George Booth, a renowned local straight shot.  This incident is still considered one of the worse tragedies in RCMP history.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a camoed film canister containing a log book and pencil. This is a busy park, with high Muggle traffic, so stealth may be required.

VThe best way to approach this one is to park at Albert McGowan park on Summit Drive and walk south to the southwest baseball diamond.  Once there, head west and look for the opening in the fence.  You'll be walking behind peoples back yards, but you won't have to walk through anyone's property and you don't have to climb any fences.\u000a\u000aThis is our second cache that we have made.  The container is rapped in green and blue tape.

The cache site is located less than 3km\u000afrom the parking area. It's a level walk/ride to the cache area and\u000athen a short scramble up some rocks to the cache site. \u000a<p>When the water level is low (early spring, late fall), the\u000atunnel is dry and you may walk through it. Conversely - when the\u000awater level is high the tunnel may only be passed through with a\u000aboat or canoe. The tunnel may be totaly submerged during very high\u000awater, but that hasn't happened in years. The picture below shows\u000athe tunnel during low water (left), and high water (right).\u000a<img src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/98603b06-0d59-4687-86cc-37d891ffca4e.jpg">\u000a</p>\u000aEnjoy your day.<br>

VThis cache was hidden as part of the finale to the spring cache blitz 2008, a FTF dash, which included 11 caches hidden all over Kamloops. Congrats to all the winners, and everyone who came out to make the event a success!\u000a\u000a"Mac park" is one of the key elements which makes Kamloops the tournament capital. It has 11 baseball fields and 6 soccer fields. It also has an arena, skate park, play ground, a BMX track, lawn bowling, a golf course, and tennis courts.  It also has a xeriscape garden; xeriscaping emphasizes the efficient use of the minimum amount of water required to sustain an attractive and functional landscape. There are trails through-out and all around the perimeter of the island, which is about a 3k walk, all flat and well maintained.

VThe Overlanders were gold seekers from Ontario who trekked across\u000athe western Interior to the Cariboo between 1858 and 1862. Most of\u000athem were young men of limited means who hoped to make their\u000afortunes in the Gold Rush. The largest group made the crossing in\u000a1862. Members gathered at the Red River Settlement in Manitoba, and\u000athe first group of about 150 people, led by Thomas McMicking, set\u000aout early in June. Two smaller groups followed. The main party's\u000aonly woman, Catherine Schubert, traveled with her husband and three\u000ayoung children; their fourth child was born after they arrived in\u000aBC. They journeyed by Red River cart and packhorse, crossing the\u000aplains to Fort Edmonton. Another group went overland south toward\u000aKamloops, two were drowned along the way and the rest almost\u000astarved. A few Overlanders found gold in the Cariboo; many remained\u000ain BC and went on to have successful careers. The cache starts in\u000aOverlander Park, behind Henry Grube Education Center, which was\u000aoriginally called Overlander School. There is an extensive beach\u000ahere at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers. At\u000ahigh water in June, the beach disappears, but the caches are\u000alocated above the high water mark. Overlander Bridge meets the park\u000aon the west side, close to the cache. This is high-muggle area so\u000asome cleverness may be required. Both caches will take some\u000asearching. The cache is small - logbooks and pencil only. Please\u000alogin and replace (both) with care.

VThis cache is a tour of an area of rock outcrops on the western\u000aflank of Mt. Dufferin. The most direct route is to park at N50'\u000a39.986, W120 25.146 and hike about a km into the first of 5 rock\u000astops. The final cache is a lock and lock filled with polished\u000astones, some of which are agates and opals, moonstones, chalcedony\u000aand various polished gemstones. Trades will be small polished\u000arocks, one for one. Each hide is a small cache, requiring some\u000asearching. Leave enough time to finish the tour, which amounts to\u000aabout 0.8 km once you get there. Nice views at stops 3 and 4. Bring\u000atrade items and enjoy the tour!

VIn 1888 the Guerin family mined coal off the flanks of Coal Hill\u000aand Iron Mask Hill. In the 1890's iron, copper, and gold were found\u000aand the Python group explored, laid claims, and mined the north and\u000awest slopes of the area. Adjacent to these hills, the Pothook Mine\u000a(now the Afton site) yielded copper and gold. By 1913 H. Wallender\u000aheaded a consortium that brought electricity and development to the\u000ahillside. 75 men worked at the mines, a hotel was built, a small\u000aschool, and homes were added until a disastrous fire in 1914.\u000aDevelopment slowed, but additional claims by the Python Group and\u000alater the Makaoo Group sunk shafts and hauled ore out of the\u000ahills.<br />\u000aFor 25 years, no mining has taken place, the shafts have mostly\u000abeen filled in, although evidence of excavation is everywhere on\u000athe north and western sides, and a few older homesteads remain in\u000athe area of Galaxy Lake. Only the names remain - Coal Hill,\u000aWallender Lake, Guerin Creek, Copperhead Drive, and Makaoo Lake.\u000a<br />\u000aThere are a few fences in the area now, some new and some old, some\u000aup and some down. The hike to the top can be made without crossing\u000aany fences, but it depends on the approach taken. It is a healthy\u000ahike to the top, following a variety of trails, mountain bike\u000apaths, old mining tracks, and skid roads. A microwave facility at\u000athe top warns newcomers to stay clear. The cache is an ammo box\u000aplaced with a view of the plateau grassland. \u000a<!-- BCGA Info Block Begin -->\u000a<table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"\u000abgcolor="#669966" align="center">\u000a<tr valign="middle">\u000a<td><a href="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://www.bcgeocaching.com/images/roundlogo-green5.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="72" height="72" alt="BCGA" title="BCGA" />\u000a     </a></td>\u000a<td><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If you are a\u000aGeocacher in the province of British Columbia, please join the\u000a<b>British Columbia Geocaching Association</b>.

VCache is located at Cataraqui Park (better known as Belle Park) on Belle Island. There are 2 stages, the 1st is a micro hidden in the forest not far from the shoreline. The 2nd is a single ammo can hidden in the forest. Redirect and cache are easily accessible by walking or biking. Round trip from the parking area should be just over 3km.

VSome of my favorite caches include an enjoyable walk hopefully just like this walk along Belle Park Fairways to Cataraqui Park. Please put the cache and redirect back \u2018exactly\u2019 as you found them so that others can have the same experience.\u000a\u000aDon't be mislead by maps showing Belle Park Drive going to Belle Island. There is no vehicle access to Belle Island anytime of year. I recommend that you park at the parking lot on Montreal Street (coordinates provided) and then walk down the road (Belle Park Drive) on the south side of the golf course to Belle Island. \u000a\u000aFrom City of Kingston Parks Department: "Please be aware that public access to the golf course is for members or those who purchase green fees. There is no public access to the course for any other reason."\u000a\u000aThe cache was loosely named after its predecessor on Belle Island "Father & Son Cache #1" (GCX5H9) by rodhsterling which was hidden in July 2006 and archived in March 2008 with 56 finds.\u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!!\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to swimmrguy, Luke, ace862, skottikus and Team Spannah on their shared FTF **

VThe cache is hidden on a point with greenspace, benches, and views\u000aof the lake. A good place for kids, dogs, bikes and strollers.\u000aHowever, if coming from Lake Ontario Park, a short section of the\u000apath is gravel and steep.\u000a<p>Please do not park in the private parking lots which are closest\u000ato the cache. The best place to leave your car is Lake Ontario\u000aPark. From there, follow the path to GZ, a 7-10 minute walk.</p>\u000a<p>The cache site is exposed to the prevailing strong SW winds. On\u000awindy days you can expect the spray from waves to soak you at GZ.\u000aThe path and site are very dark at night. Terrain for most of the\u000apath leading to the cache is 1, and just a bit rougher at GZ.</p>\u000a<p>When <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMHZcgM11GU">Dave\u000aUlmer hid the very first cache</a> in May 2000, he was testing and\u000acelebrating the removal of selective availability (which increased\u000athe accuracy of GPS). But he didn't just hide a rock or a note. He\u000ahid a logbook and swag, including the now famous "can of beans". He\u000awas having some fun. That's the point, have fun geocaching!</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

VSCUTTLEHOLES - MOIRA RIVER This area is considered to be an\u000aoutstanding example of a karst development which is only uncommonly\u000afound throughout Ontario. The Moira Karst site extends from Latta\u000ain the south to Chisholm's Mill in the north. The Ontario Ministry\u000aof Natural Resources has deemed the area to be ANSI (Area of\u000aNatural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is geologically &amp;\u000aecologically sensitive. As such, please stay on the clearly marked\u000atrail &amp; respect the area immediately surrounding the cache\u000asite. Unique geological features have been created in the limestone\u000abedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range\u000afrom sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone\u000aislands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the\u000ariver actually disappear underground only to resurface further\u000adownstream. While many of the geological formations are on private\u000aproperty (such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of\u000apassageways) &amp; not available to the public, a good example of a\u000ascuttlehole can be seen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761. It is\u000aapproximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be\u000aentered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution\u000a&amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a\u000alimestone formation. It is unnecessary to enter the cave as the\u000acache is located about 40 m away. What's really strange about the\u000aarea is that during July , August &amp; into September you can walk\u000aon sections of the dry limestone riverbed. However, during the\u000aspring runoff the Moira River Canoe Club perform their annual\u000awhitewater races in the same location!! From the cave location you\u000acan see the guy wires that hold the racing gates stretched across\u000athe river. The cache is available year round but exploration of the\u000aentire area is best during the months listed above. Pictures (taken\u000aover the past 2 years) of the cave, dry riverbed &amp; whitewater\u000akayaking all taken within 100 m of the cave location are included\u000awith this listing.\u000a<p><b>Enjoy but please use caution with kids near the river during\u000athe spring runoff &amp; at other times due to several visible\u000acollapsed sinkholes and open caves.</b></p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to butterfly5 on the FTF!!</p>

V<strong>ABOUT THIS CACHE:</strong><br />\u000a Why travel to London, UK, to visit the famous Pimlico, when we\u000ahave one right here in K-town. Sure Winston Churchill never lived\u000aat this Pimlico, but the house prices are far more\u000areasonable.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease bring your own pen. The hide is shallow so be sure and cover\u000ait up again. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a <br />\u000a Congrats to Swimmrguy on the dinner missing FTF.

VThis is the new and improved relocated-re-cached original hide of the WHISTLING SWANS WETLAND geocache. This cache had to be rewritten due to the nature of the DISTANCE that this cache has been placed so it is a REAL bonus for those who want to re-visit the site and log a new number. There is an abundance of free space here for dog walkers and for children who like to explore and climb around some neat ol dead falls. It is a free open space(donated by the pre-existing DuPont plant) seldom visited and not domesticated for visitors. An added bonus to this land space is the viewing areas it affords of the marshland. If you are lucky you might get a glimpse of the "DUCKS UNLIMITED" and enjoy the spot for a lovely quiet snack during your geocaching of the Kingston area and of the Cataraqui Creek Marshlands.\u000aAs this area is used by a number of "non-scooping" dog walkers be mindful of their refuse and walk carefully particularly along the northwest trail if you decide to follow that line.\u000aIn the Spring there is a great number of interesting waterfowl to capture with your camera and you can even access this cache if you decided to by launching a kayak from King Street and Auld Road! \u000a\u000aCongratulations on a combined FTF to bluelamb03, Remote Sensor, Mr. PackRat, mTn_biker65 and mm_dancer. Special congratulations from "The Swan" to mTn_biker65 on his 100th FTF. The wetlands is honoured by the presence of such greatness. Woo Hoo! KAG rocks!

VCache is placed to commemorate our 40th Anniversary (May 18, 1968).\u000a\u000aThere is a Martello Tower nearby (Canada's First Line of Defense against invasion - Shock &amp; Awe Eh!), a cross in honour of the Daughters of the Empire (I don't think Palamino is a member), Kingston General Hospital where Palamino was born and worked - but wait there is more. Rumour has it that during the 60's important naval exercises took place off shore here in the dark of night, now I can't confirm that and when I mentioned it to Palamino she yelled "I don't know what you are talking about". Maybe a cacher with navy experience can shed some light on this if it isn't a matter of "National Security" or perhaps "Personal Security". \u000a\u000aAnyway Palamino is a native Kingstonian, I'm an import in '61 from several places in Canada and one in Europe, we got together in '64, first date was to a KCVI dance, the rest is past, present and future. \u000aIts been a blast Palamino and hiding a cache together to commemorate it is like the "Icing on the Cake". Speaking of the cake my father made and decorated the wedding cake. Can I do that? NOT A CHANCE! \u000a\u000aCOSMIC CONNECTION: This is also our 40th hide (not planned), this is #29 for Runaway46 &amp; Palamino has 11.\u000a\u000aThe only caching we did 40 years ago was without a GPSr which made it somewhat difficult since all the caches had been hidden without a GPSr. Come to think of it we didn't find any, go figure!\u000a\u000aPlease enjoy our cache, it is not difficult as has been our custom.\u000a\u000a\u000a****Congrats to Team Jevre on a quick FTF, we are watching the action from afar in Lake Placid, NY****

VIt\u2019s hard to imagine that this tiny park situated at the end of this well established neighbourhood was once the site of a tannery.  For 40 years P.R. Lamb\u2019s Glue and Blacking Factory spewed noxious chemicals and animal waste into the now lost Lamb\u2019s creek.  These practices continued until 1888 when the underinsured building burnt to the ground, I would think, much to the relief of the nearby residents.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a screw cap container and some level of stealth is required as there are usually 1 or 2 dog walkers in the park.

V<h3>George Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium</h3>\u000a<p>The George Taylor Richardson Stadium, which is located on\u000aQueen's West Campus, is actually the second facility to bear that\u000aname. The original stadium was located where Mackintosh-Corry Hall\u000aand its parking lot now stand. It was opened in 1921, having been\u000abuilt on a piece of land bought from a community of nuns. This was\u000athe stadium where the great football teams of old played, and where\u000aFranklin Delano Roosevelt received his honourary degree from\u000aQueen's on August 18, 1938. President Roosevelt made a historical\u000aspeech here that was seen as a departure from American\u000aisolationism.</p>\u000a<p>When a new social sciences complex (Mackintosh-Corry Hall) was\u000aplanned, the original stadium was torn down and relocated to the\u000anewly acquired West Campus. Many staff, students, and alumni were\u000avery upset about the move, feeling that the stadium belonged in the\u000aheart of campus. The project went ahead, however, and featured a\u000aceremony in which a piece of sod from the old stadium was\u000atransplanted to the new one. More than thirty years later, the\u000aGeorge Taylor Richardson Memorial Stadium is still a big part of\u000aUniversity life. It is named in memory of George Taylor Richardson,\u000aa Queen's graduate renowned for his athleticism and sportsmanship\u000awho died in WWI. The original stadium was funded by George's\u000abrother, James Armstrong Richardson, graduate and Chancellor of\u000aQueen's.</p>\u000a<p>This an easy micro for my first cache.

VAs you may or may not know, I\u2019m very passionate about geocaching. I\u2019ve met a lot of exceptionally great people and had some very cool experiences. I\u2019ve seen places that I would have almost certainly never seen before and challenged myself in ways that I thought were, if not impossible, then definitely improbable. In experiencing the total geocaching experience, I\u2019ve had to travel. I\u2019ve been caching internationally as well as domestically and I\u2019ve noticed one very interesting thing, that regional cachers have a distinct identity. In Kingston it\u2019s the KAG\u2019ers, in Ottawa it\u2019s the CCC\u2019ers.\u000a Well in Brockville, we\u2019re caught between two mighty empires that both have a lot to offer, but wait, a new empire has arisen, quietly, very stealth like. It\u2019s a group of mighty geocachers called the BAGGERS (Brockville and Area Geocachers) and my friends in time, if your cache hasn\u2019t been BAG\u2019d, then it truly hasn\u2018t realized the total caching experience. However, we Baggers are a kind and compassionate people and we\u2019d like all cachers, from everywhere to come join us. We want Brockville to be a caching destination and in doing so I\u2019m starting a six cache micro series with a medium sized traditional cache final. It is my hope that in doing so people will come and see that Baggers are a cool lot and invite us to neat caching functions.\u000a\u000a The first three caches in the series (#1,2 and 3) contain the numbers to the latitudinal coordinates and the second three caches (#4, 5 and 6) contain the numbers to the longitudinal coordinates. Thus, to obtain the coordinates to the final, you have to get all six micro caches first. The caches are all magnetic key holders and are in very public, high muggle areas, so please be careful and collect the six micros with stealth. You\u2019ll have to bring a writing instrument as the caches have no room for such implements. The final is literally full of booty with a gift certificate for golf at Sunnidell Golf Course being the prize for the FTF, it also contains geocoins, travel bugs and swag a plenty at the time of placement. So please come to Brockville and enjoy the city and a day of geocaching. \u000a\u000aCheers\u000aCanadianzombie\u000a\u000a*Congrats to Geogranny and Binrat for braving a cold rainy night for the FTF\u000a\u000aEdit: Evidently I made an error in saying the first 3 caches were longitudinal coordinates, when in fact they were latitudinal and vice versa. Thanks for the assistance Wareed. It has been changed in the cache log description.

V<p>Need an excuse to go for a walk? Lemoines Point Conservation\u000aArea, [http://www.cataraquiregion.on.ca/lands/lemoine.htm] ,\u000aalready a cache-rich environment, now has another to add to the\u000amix, a replacement for a similar cache close to this spot. It is\u000ahidden half way along Meadowlark Lane (see trail map photo) and\u000aabout 5m. off the trail. Meadowlark Lane is a lesser used but nicer\u000atrail which parallels the east boundary fence and joins up with the\u000amain trails at either end. At times of the year there may be poison\u000aoak/ivy and mosquitoes when off the trail.</p>\u000a<p>Please note that after a rain the trail from the south parking\u000alot will have several wet sections.</p>\u000a<p>Access to the park is free, although restricted to daylight\u000ahours. Parking is available (see parking lot photos) at either the\u000asouth lot, N44 13.212 W076 36.400, or the north lot, N44 13.940\u000aW076 36.555. Please avoid spoiler photos.</p>

VGeocaching brings you to many hidden places, that you never would\u000ahave visited, or even known existed. I have dedicated this series\u000ato the Hidden Parks of Kingston (HPOK) that seem be stuck inbetween\u000ahouses, hidden from anyone but a local.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThis letterbox is located at Pimlico Park (although google maps\u000asays the park is a street west, there are only houses there), when\u000asearching for this cache stay on the path as long as possible to\u000aavoid unnecessary bushwacking. As this cache will be released on\u000aHalloween, it has a Halloween theme. The cache is divided into two\u000asections, one contains the log book, stamp and ink pad (please do\u000anot remove any of these items) and the other side is filled with\u000aregular Halloween SWAG, please try to trade Halloween related items\u000a(but not candy).<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font size="4" color="red"><b>Congratulations to ptowferret on the\u000aFTF</b></font>

V<p>SOLVING THE PUZZLE<br />\u000aThe cache is not at the posted location. To find the cache solve\u000athis silly riddle: What is a geocacher\u2019s favourite kind of\u000anut?<br />\u000a<br />\u000aConvert only the first six letters of the nut into numbers using\u000aa=1, b=2, etc. (Use only the second digit for 2-digit\u000anumbers.)<br />\u000a<br />\u000aInsert these converted numbers into the coordinates:<br />\u000a N44 13.(1st letter)(2nd letter)(3rd letter)<br />\u000a W076 36.(4th letter)(5th letter)(6th letter)</p>\u000a<p>You can check your answers for this puzzle on\u000a<a href="http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=1fb99c8c6e43218eafeeaba37d70c32d&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433148385431&amp;name=476f204e75747321">\u000aGeochecker.com</a>.</p>\u000a<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />\u000aStay on the trail all the way to Ground Zero. At that point look\u000afor the tall bush marked with orange tape just off the trail. (see\u000aspoiler photo). The cache is behind this bush. Don't go straight\u000athough, but go around and come in from the back. The cache is a\u000acamouflaged peanut butter jar on the ground inside the framework of\u000abranches. There is no need to uncover anything. Contents and FTF\u000aprize are kid-related. Please make sure the lid is tight and put it\u000aback just as you found it. Have fun kids, but be careful or you'll\u000abe seen by muggles walking nearby.</p>

VKensington Market is one of my favorite places in the city, especially on Pedestrian Sundays.\u000aPedestrian Sundays happen on the last Sunday of every month from May to October.\u000aThey close the neighbourhood streets to cars.\u000aMusicians and artists of every kind take over.\u000aFood is also a highlight of Pedestrian Sundays.\u000aFrom common goodies like roasted corn on the cob to exotic Tibetan Momos.\u000a\u000aSome of the best views of Kensington are located at the cache, interesting views of the city too.\u000a\u000aNow for some hints...\u000aIf you are at the cache coordinates and standing at street level, look up!\u000aChicken level(5)!\u000aIf you see eight horizontal cables you are very close!\u000a\u000aCache is a lockable plastic container with a log book and writing utensils.\u000a\u000aThere is a nice little geode for the first to find.\u000a>>>Congrats to emzernask for the FTF!\u000a\u000aGood luck!

VThis is our fourth cache, but our first in Ontario. One of the BoiBou Geocaching team happen to work nearby.\u000a\u000aThe train doesn't stop in Summerstown Station no more but we hope lot's of Geocachers will, and that this cache will become a station for many TBs and GCoins!!\u000a\u000aTHE CACHE IS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE RAILROAD AND CAN BE EASILY AND SAFELY FOUND THROUGH THE ROAD NEARBY. NO NEED TO GET NEAR THE TRACKS NOR CROSSING THEM. \u000aThe marker on google map is misleading, as the cache is actually on Hay Road side, NOT NEAR THE 401 !!!\u000a\u000aPLEASE TRY TO FAIRLY TRADE GEOCOINS AND TB'S, OR BETTER: DROP AN EXTRA ONE!!! AND DON`T FORGET TO LOG THE TRACKABLE NUMBERS ASAP.\u000aIT'S ALWAYS DISAPPOINTING TO VISIT A CACHE AND FIND THAT SOME OR ALL TB'S ARE MISSING!!!\u000a__________________________________________________________\u000a\u000a\u000aLA GARE DE TB DE SUMMERSTOWN STATION\u000a\u000aVoici notre quatrième cache, mais notre première en Ontario.

N'APPROCHEZ ET NE TRAVERSEZ PAS LES VOIES FERRÉES.\u000aLe marqueur sur la petite carte de Google Map porte à confusion car la cache est du côté de Hay Road, PAS DE LA 401 !!!\u000a\u000aESSAYEZ D'ÉCHANGER LES GÉOCOINS ET TB'S DE FAÇON JUSTE, OU MIEUX METTEZ-EN UN DE PLUS!!! ET N'OUBLIEZ PAS D'ENREGISTRER LES # DE TRACKING: C'EST TOUJOURS DÉCEVANT DE VISITER UNE CACHE OÙ LES "TRACKABLES" SONT MANQUANTS.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aContenu original/ Original content:\u000a\u000a- Logbook, Crayon/Pencil, Aiguisoir/Sharpener, Feuillet explicatif du Géeocaching/ GC explanation sheet\u000a- GeoCoin "Skunkie" (TB23JKX)\u000a- Travel Bug "Le Boulon" (TB19348)\u000a- Sifflet/Whistle\u000a- Auto de course / Race car\u000a- Balle/Baseball\u000a- Aiguisoir Smiley Pen Sharpener\u000a- 2$ for a 6/49 for the FTF: Congrats to QueenApis/ 2$ pour un 6/49 pour le PAT: Félicitations à QueenApis

VLegend has it that back in  the 1840s some adventuresome folks, lured by the gold rush and the promise of a much better climate, decided that they wanted to find their fortune in sunny California. Off they started from Elgin, which is just a few kilometres east of here. They quickly discovered how difficult it was to slog through forests, climb over rocky cliffs and wade through bogs. Too bad they weren't looking for a cache - that would've kept them motivated!\u000a \u000aSince they didn't want to tell the folks back home that they didn't get anywhere close to California, they did the next best thing. They halted their travels, looked around and decided that they'd found a pretty nice place already. So they built houses and a school and CALLED it California.   However, they found absolutely no gold  and the climate...? - no improvement there! \u000a \u000aThis is a small cache with a logbook, something for the FTF and a few items to trade. This is my first cache. I hope you enjoy the peaceful setting.\u000aLink to handicaching.com: http://www.handicaching.com/show.php?waypoint=GC1GG5M

VThe TIME structure is a waterfront landmark.\u000a<p>Situated on reclaimed land (from the excavation of nearby\u000aunderground parking lots) the structure is the subject of local\u000alore and conjecture. Some believe it is built on an underground\u000ageological fault, and the two pieces measure the earth shifting.\u000aOthers thought the two pieces would TOUCH at the stroke of Y2K.\u000aCould it be the top of a secret underground vault? Maybe it's some\u000akind of solar alarm clock?</p>\u000a<p>There is street parking near GZ. But the best way to reach GZ is\u000ato follow the waterfront path. The path is kid, bike, dog,\u000arollerblade, and wheelchair friendly. On a nice day, plan to stay a\u000awhile and enjoy the incredible view of Lake Ontario. This cache is\u000avery kid and dog friendly, so long as you stay away from nearby\u000aKing street.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

They set up the board, and set it up. Jaymee, choosing\u000ato play as the dog, went first. She landed on \u201cChance\u201d and drew a\u000acard, \u201cAdvance token to the nearest Railroad and pay owner Twice\u000athe Rental to which he is otherwise entitled. If Railroad is\u000aunowned, you may buy it from the Bank.\u201d She moved her piece to\u000aPennsylvania Railroad and bought it for $200. Jon, determined to\u000acatch up, rolled and moved his car only to land on \u201cIncome Tax\u201d and\u000awas forced to pay over $200 to the bank. Jaymee\u2019s turn and her dog\u000alanded on Kentucky Avenue, which she promptly purchased for $220.\u000aJon moved his car to \u201cVermont Avenue\u201d and purchased it for $100.\u000aJaymee\u2019s dog moved, again landing on a red property; this time\u000a\u201cIndiana Avenue\u201d, which she purchases as well for $220. Jon rolled\u000aand much to his surprised, landed on \u201cNew York Avenue\u201d, which was\u000asoon his after he handed over $200. Jaymee continued her buying\u000astreak, by landing on \u201cNorth Carolina Avenue\u201d for $300. It was now\u000aJon\u2019s turn to land on \u201cChance\u201d and he drew \u201cYou have been elected\u000achairman of the board. Pay each player $50\u201d. As Jon handed Jaymee\u000a$50, he grumbled about how he did not like how the game was turning\u000aout so far. Jaymee rolled, and landed on \u201cMediterranean Avenue\u201d,\u000aand collected $200 as she pasted Go. Not one to let money burn a\u000ahole in her pocket, she quickly bought the property for $60. Jon,\u000adesperate to catch up, landed on \u201cPacific Avenue\u201d which he bought\u000afor $300 with the intention of holding on to it in order to sell it\u000aback to Jaymee at a much higher price. Jaymee moved her dog to\u000a\u201cReading Railroad\u201d, where she purchased her second railroad of the\u000agame. Jon rolled and landed on \u201cBoardwalk\u201d, which he quickly buys\u000afor $400. Jaymee moved onto \u201cChance\u201d and read aloud her card, \u201cPay\u000apoor tax of $15\u201d, which she promptly did. Jon moved and landed on\u000a\u201cMediterranean Avenue\u201d where paid Jaymee rent with some of the $200\u000ahe collected from passing Go. This luck did not last long, for just\u000athen Jaymee jumped up exclaiming \u201cI have an idea for our next\u000acache\u201d and ran out of the room, leaving the game\u000aunfinished.\u201d

VRecent (past 25 years) plantings of white pine are plentiful in this conservation area. Eastern White Pine is the official tree of Ontario and the states of Michigan and Maine.  Harvested without mercy in years past, as they were great for supplying masts for sailing vessels.  Enjoy the area as always, plenty of other hides in here so make it a caching adventure.  \u000a\u000aNo FTF prize just greater glory in the Kingdom of Geo!\u000a\u000aThe park is closed from dusk to dawn, please respect this.

This is the kind of puzzle that you must be\u000ain the right place to solve. First find the redirect at the\u000apublished coords. You will be sent to the place (nothing hidden\u000athere) where you will solve the puzzle. When you solve the puzzle,\u000ayou will know where to find the cache. Sound confusing? It's not!\u000aIn fact, I'll just tell you exactly where the cache is\u000ahidden...it's in a pipe under Kingston...so just go get it! Give it\u000aa try, and have fun!</p>\u000a<p>Kingston has a great waterfront. The redirect is located at the\u000awater treatment plant at the end of the waterfront trail. Water is\u000adrawn from the lake into the treatment plant. From there the water\u000ais piped underground, all over the city.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is in a pipe under Kingston.</p>\u000a<center>\u000a<a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" /></a></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />

VMany hours were spent by Slider&Jack to design this whimsical cache, their first.\u000a\u000aOff two secondary trails in beautiful High Park. Don't get wet!\u000a\u000aTake your time and read all the fun messages.  We're proud of the team and the cache's originality. Please ensure it is covered up when you replace it, as it is very colourful. \u000a\u000aThe cache now contains many military items donated from a Captain in the army...very cool stuff!! The added puzzle is to figure out what rank the epaulets indicate.\u000a\u000aCache also includes a log book and a pen and a pencil to record your visit.\u000a\u000aA good place for CITO.  The area certainly needs it after the winter.  Bring some plastic bags!\u000a\u000aHope you enjoy it.

VA nano placed as a lame tribute cache for a friend who introduced\u000ame to geocaching and who has recently walked, ridden or sailed his\u000away to a significant milestone This guy once said to me (after a\u000areally tough and 'painful' caching experience), "The way things are\u000agoing around here what I really want to do is post a cache with no\u000aco-ordinates and say, 'A nano. Hidden in Kingston. Good Luck on\u000aFTF'." I said, "Now that's an idea. But certainly Not _ _ _!" So,\u000athis is that cache...sort of.

VKingston Penitentiary first opened in 1835. It is a federal maximum\u000asecurity prison which houses 400 of the worst criminal offenders in\u000athe country (like Paul Bernardo). Almost half of the inmates are\u000aserving life sentences. The previous successful escape from\u000aKingston Penitentiary was in 1958.\u000a<p>On May 7, 1999, Tyrone Conn, serving a 47 year sentence for bank\u000arobbery, escaped from Kingston Penitentiary not far from this\u000acache. On the calendar in his cell he had written "Gone Fishin".\u000aBut a dummy slept in his bunk. The evening before, Conn hid in a\u000aworkshop area. Late that night, alone in the workshop, he fashioned\u000aa grappling hook (a bent piece of metal bar), rope (canvas strips\u000afrom mailbags), and an 18 foot ladder (made from dismantling a\u000awooden cabinet). He broke out of the workshop and scurried across\u000athe prison yard to the wall. He climbed his ladder, attached his\u000agrappler to the top of the 23 foot wall, and lowered himself down\u000aon the other side! As he ran along the waterfront he sprinkled\u000acayenne pepper on his trail to throw off the dogs. By the time his\u000aescape gear was noticed the next morning, he was long gone.</p>\u000a<p>Enter the municipal marina from Yonge street, or by foot/bike\u000afrom King street. Follow the dirt road south on the east side of\u000athe marina.</p>\u000a<p>Trust your GPS. Excellent sky here. If you can find exactly GZ,\u000ayou will likely be right over the cache. Accuracy of 1m is common\u000ahere. You can save yourself alot of searching this way.</p>\u000a<p>Please don't forget to take a moment and enjoy the view from GZ.\u000aThe cache is in a public park attached to the marina. It is NOT on\u000aKP property. Stay off KP property. Respect KP fences and signage.\u000aDo not use the KP parking lot.</p>\u000a<p>**CAUTION** GZ can be a good place to drop gear, keys, wallets,\u000aand valuables into the water, or between the rocks as you search.\u000aPlease be aware of this risk before searching. Consider taking the\u000acache to the nearby bench in the park to open and sign.</p>\u000a<p>**CAUTION** GZ is NOT WINTER FRIENDLY. Snow and ice at GZ will\u000amake it very hazardous. Best to wait for better weather.</p>\u000a<p>Congratulations to everyone who rushed out for the FTF\u000arace:<br />\u000aFTF bullockj, jevre<br />\u000a2TF umilik<br />\u000a3TF star-guy, fantabulous, hypocorism</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"><img src=\u000a"http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif" border=\u000a"0" /></a></center>

VA great trail through the woods with lots to see along the way.\u000aI'll leave it to the log entries to describe what you might find. \u000a<p>Please follow the directions to the trailhead, no tresspassing\u000arequired. Turn south off highway 2 at the waypoint given (stone\u000agate topped with lions). Proceed about 400m down this paved\u000alaneway, then turn right immediately after the second stone gate,\u000afollowing the "cemetery" signs. There is a clearly marked parking\u000aarea. Follow your GPS west to the trailhead.</p>\u000a<p>Follow the main trail above the shoreline. Go past Binrat's\u000aRevenge. Go past One in a Million. Keep to the trail, and continue\u000awest further than you would expect before turning north to approach\u000aGZ. There is no need to bushwack until you are within 10m of\u000aGZ.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is about 10m north of the trail and is not on the\u000aground. It's an easy find. However, the area around GZ is a GPS\u000adead zone. From the stone bridge, take about 35 steps along the\u000apath, then make a sharp right into the bush and walk about 20 steps\u000ato the bank of the small creek. Turn around, and you should see the\u000acache. It is close to the creek, on a small tree. The cache is\u000acamo'd but not at all hidden. It is not near any fallen tree or\u000astump.</p>\u000a<p>This short hike should take about 30 minutes round trip from the\u000aparking coords. There are some steep and slippery sections which\u000amay not be suitable for small children. Dogs will love this place.\u000aBug repellent recommended.</p>\u000a<p>The trailhead is only a few kilometers east of Kingston, and\u000amakes a pleasant bike ride. There is a paved bike lane at the edge\u000aof hwy2. The trail is not entirely ridable by mountain bike, so you\u000amay want to leave your bike near the parking coords (locked of\u000acourse).</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

This mid-term exam cache is a\u000aCanadian reward for solving the first 9 caches in the series before\u000atrying the final exam! Solving this series will definitely help you\u000abuild your puzzle-solving skills for attacking Kingston's plethora\u000aof puzzle caches. Each puzzle contains a lesson focusing on a\u000aspecific skill, examples of how to use it, and an exercise to test\u000ayour new abilities. Study the lesson, complete the exercise, and\u000ayou'll find the location of a geocache (albeit in Florida). If\u000ayou've been paying attention to the lessons in this series, you\u000ashould have no trouble passing this local mid-term exam (without\u000ahaving to travel south of the border!). Don't be afraid to try\u000aanything you've learned. You may already have completed much of the\u000awork for this cache as part of the puzzle solving tutorial posted\u000aon the Kingston Area Geocacher's website over the past year. I hope\u000ayou kept your answers!

VBeside the beautiful St. James' Cathedral, St. James' Park features one of Toronto's nicest gardens. Kept meticulously clean by the Toronto Garden Society, \u000a\u000aThe garden is always planted with fresh flowers, always immaculately cared for no matter the season. There are several benches to catch some afternoon sun, some sculptures, a fountain and a large gazebo with often holds outdoor concerts. It's a great 19th century style garden oasis, and a highly recommended photo place.\u000a\u000aInterestingly enough,  St. James\u2019 Park used to be a cemetery of early York, but even though those bodies were moved in 1850 the park is still home to the great Cholera pits of 19th century Toronto where it\u2019s estimated more than 5,000 bodies are still buried beneath the grassy slopes at its northern end.\u000a\u000aAt the centre of the park is a statue of Robert Fleming Gourlay, an early political reformer who came to York from Scotland in 1817 and believed in open protest and petitioning as legal constitutional means of achieving reform. \u000a\u000aHe was banished from York in 1819 after he stood up in Parliament and said (I paraphrase) \u201cGentlemen I ask you, before you pass this particular bill ask yourselves, is it good for the people?\u201d to which Parliament replied \u201cWhat the hell do the people have to do with it?\u201d He was rescinded in 1839, returned to Toronto in 1856, but after failing to be elected to Parliament in 1858, he went back to Scotland. \u000a\u000aHis statue erected in the summer of 2004 stands purposefully facing St James Cathedral the burial place of his non-reformist enemy, John Strachan who after his death in 1867 was interned underneath the cathedral.

VNice view from this location, better at night.\u000a\u000aThe Christie Pits neighbourhood is named after the former Christie Sand Pits, a local landmark in this area which operated until the early 1900's. Christie Street is named after William Mellis Christie, who co-founded the Christie & Brown Cookie Company in downtown Toronto in 1861. Mr. Christie makes good cookies.\u000a\u000aThe Christie Sand Pits were rich in sand, gravel and clay deposits - remnants of the last ice age. These deposits were excavated in the late 1800's and early 1900's and used in the construction of many of Toronto's early roadways and public buildings.\u000a\u000aBy 1909, the Christie Sand Pits were depleted and the city turned the former quarry into Willowvale Park. However, the Christie Pits name has endured and is used in reference to the park as well as the surrounding neighbourhood to this day.\u000a\u000aStealth is required lots of muggles.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFTF to emzernask, congrats

VThe Kingston Memorial Centre is one of the classic \u201cold barns\u201d of\u000ahockey. It was built in 1950 and not much has changed both inside\u000aand out since there. The Centre is home to the Kingston Sports Hall\u000aof Fame, the Fall Agricultural Fair, and of course to the OHL\u000aFrontenacs. Kingston politics would not be the same without the\u000aCentre as it seems that council spends an inordinate amount of time\u000adiscusses its fate. Come down explore the building and the grounds.\u000aJust be careful on the playing field, it is popular spot to let\u000adogs run free.

VThe cache is not at the coordinates they are for the air photo library of MTO.\u000aIn order to solve this cache you must view the historic air photos of Kingston.  You must then figure out the coordinates for the indicated spot. Google Earth is a great aid for this part. Some of these features still exist, many don't.  Finding a long time resident of Kingston would be very helpful.  The missing number is always the digit following the decimal in GPS format (degree, decimal minutes) ie. 44 25.X98 or 76 47.X31.  The latest version of Google Earth supports this format.   The picture indicates if you should use the latitude or longitude.  Most of the time both the latitude and longitude are used, this provides a little bit of a self check.\u000a\u000aThe cache is at:\u000a44 AB.CD9\u000a76 EF.GH4\u000a\u000aNo coordinate checker or check sum on this one (takes out the reverse engineering/guessing option).\u000a\u000aCongratulations Cumbrian Lass and Bluesaway on the FTF, how fitting that a Geographer would solve it.

Please follow the well marked path to answer the questions to\u000alog this earthcache.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aEnjoy but please use caution with kids near the river during the\u000aspring runoff &amp; at all other times due to several visible\u000acollapsed sinkholes.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThis area is considered to be an outstanding example of a karst\u000adevelopment which is only uncommonly found throughout Ontario. The\u000aMoira Karst site extends from Latta in the south to Chisholm's Mill\u000ain the north.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has deemed the area to be\u000aANSI (Area of Natural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is\u000ageologically &amp; ecologically sensitive.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs such, please respect the area immediately surrounding the given\u000acoordinates.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aUnique geological features have been created in the limestone\u000abedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range\u000afrom sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone\u000aislands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the\u000ariver actually disappear underground only to resurface further\u000adownstream.<br />\u000aWhile many of the geological formations are on private property\u000a(such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of passageways) &amp;\u000anot available to the public, a good example of a scuttlehole can be\u000aseen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761.<br />\u000aIt is approximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be\u000aentered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution\u000a&amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a\u000alimestone formation.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aTo Log this Earth Cache, Please email us through geocaching.com\u000awith the following information:<br />\u000a<br />\u000a1. Email the waypoints as to where you feel a portion of the river\u000adisappears underground and resurfaces again. An approximation of 5\u000am is fine as we do not want you to get too close to the edge of the\u000ariver. Please use discretion. If possible but not necessary, please\u000aprovide pictures.<br />\u000a2. What is the measured distance between these two points? Are\u000athere any other places where the river emerges in the immediate\u000avicinity?<br />\u000a<br />\u000a3.

VThis summer, acting on a suggestion from Hamburking, we tried geocaching for the very first time. I guess you could say we were hooked immediately. 70 or so caches and many hours of fun later, we decided that it was about time we gave back to the community. Soooo\u2026\u000a\u000aThis cache is a big Thank-You to all the cachers in the area who have obviously put a lot of time and effort into making their caches interesting and challenging.  [:)]\u000a\u000aThis is our first attempt at hiding a cache. We\u2019ve particularly enjoyed the puzzle caches and the urban caches, so we thought\u2026 what better place to start!\u000a\u000aWe hope you enjoy!\u000a\u000aTo find the co-ordinates you must solve the following puzzle which is loosely based on Quantagories. Example: \u000a"_ _ L of the A" translates to "26 Letters of the Alphabet" \u000a\u000a[;)]\u000a_ _ _ D C at which W B (at S L)\u000aW _ to _ (W a W to M a L)\u000a_ _ _ _ _ _ S in a W\u000a_ _ S M to a D of L\u000a_ E _ H F P P E\u000a_ _ D in a R A\u000a_ F O the C N\u000a_ O of _ A B\u000a_ S to the W\u000aN _ L of M\u000a_ on the F\u000aS the _ S\u000aL _ L C\u000a_ Y I\u000a\u000aN & W co-ordinates (not necessarily in that order) are:\u000azl sd.cvo & hw ru.yxq  \u000a\u000aPictures are welcome but no spoilers please.\u000a\u000aDon\u2019t forget to check out the obvious local attractions. There is plenty of public parking around, so please avoid the private parking areas.\u000a\u000aThere is a small prize for the FTF.\u000a\u000aFTF \u2013 Skottikus (in under 3 hours) -  WTG!\u000a2TF \u2013 (Shared) mTn_biker65, TamiMaRo and Bullockj \u2013 Well done!\u000a3TF \u2013 (Shared) canadianzombie, swimmrguy, Bluesaway, Binrat and Geogranny - Kudo's on an epic search.

VThis is my very first hide and I hope to have it published on the date of my geocaching anniversary. When we were kids we would hop on our bicycles and MAKE trails to these parts of the woodland. We play hide and seek for hours and created  all kinds of neat "woodland" games. It was always referred to as "Hiawatha's Hideaway". The last couple of years the Field Naturalists have placed nest boxes for the wood ducks here. It is a great place for birders. In the late fall and early winter months this is a sheltered spot where one can often catch sight of whistling swans and the rare glimpse of Snowy Owls. In the spring and in the fall this is a wonderful sanctuary for birds and other forms of wildlife such as beavers, muskrat , raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes and deer. For those more adventuresome, AND interested in birding,you can paddle a kayak or a canoe right up to this spot in season. Take your time on this trail and enjoy the wildlife and the sounds of nature. If you are lucky you might also see the nearby Disney Red Roof Inn. Reservations are not required.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS SKOTTIKUS ON THE FTF

VA new mall has been "birthed" in this area and I thought it a good place to bring people out to so people could take a look around at the way things are changing in the north end of town off Division Street. There is a lot of construction going on at the moment so be on the alert for crews of workers and lots of MUD at the moment. The cache is a micro sized silver container that at the time of placement had only a small log and a prize for the FTF. Please bring your own pen or pencil to log your find. It will be interesting to watch the BIRTHING of this new mall as more and more stores come to this "Outlet".\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO SKOTTIKUS on the FTF... even though bullockj might consider it a "miscarriage of geocaching justice"  to have to be in two places at one time.

VMany years ago when this retirement residence and care facility were in the initial development stages there was an announcement made by the developer and the City of Kingston for people to come and take as many trilliums as they wished. The area was carpetted with trilliums and other wildflowers in the Spring and when the facility would be built all the trilliums would have been destroyed.\u000a\u000aI can remember racing to get here, just about as fast as a geocacher would for the race for first to find...but in my case or possibly like my race for FTF in geocaching ... I was late and the trilliums were all but gone. There were hundreds and hundreds of people about that day and the good news was that thousands of trilliums were on the move to be transplanted to other parts of the City. It was for the ridges of Trilliums on this parkland that the facility bears the name: TRILLIUM RIDGE.\u000a\u000aToday as I came back to visit a dear friend who resides in Trillium Ridge I got a glimpse of this park. I had never noticed it before and it was just begging for a geocache. So...here it is.\u000a\u000aPlease do not night cache in this area as it is considered an URBAN hide and with any URBAN hide there are inherent safety risks with unknown persons lingering in the many areas of this dimly lit park. This cache is a PREFERRED DAYLIGHT cache type. \u000a\u000aThere are a few ways to find the cache's GZ and depending on which you choose you will either  keep dry or get wet.\u000a\u000aThere may be some obstacle to obtaining this cache but if I can "reach it" I believe anyone can. And if you know me...I am afraid of heights.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a small flat container capable of some coins or small tb items but not much more. \u000a\u000aThere is no "prize" here for the FTF. I believe to have the JOY of caches placed in December, those that elongate the season for hunting, walking and FUN...well that should be sufficient for all who enjoy this wonderful GAME! \u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO RUNAWAY46 ON THE FTF WOO HOO THE COUNTRY BOY MAKES THE GEOCACHING FIND A CITY SLICK-ER! WOO HOO!

VCache is not at these coordinates, but is nearby.  The coordinates lead to the plaque commemorating the memorial.  To determine the coordinates for the final cache, you will need to go review the memorial itself.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to SQU1RE and SACARAH for the FTF.\u000a\u000aOntario Police Memorial - Preserving the memory of fallen officers\u000a\u000aThe Ontario Police Memorial is dedicated to all of the brave police officers in Ontario\u2019s history who have lost their lives in the line of duty.\u000a\u000aThe memorial is made up of a bronze statue of a male and female officer standing atop a large granite pedestal. The names of fallen officers are carved into a granite wall \u2013 the Wall of Honour \u2013 that stands on each side of the pedestal.\u000a\u000aThe words, \u201cHeroes in Life, Not Death,\u201d are carved on the memorial. This is to recognize that police officers risk their lives, every day, to protect people and neighbourhoods, and deserve the respect and gratitude of the citizens they serve. The Ontario Police Memorial is in a small park at the corner of Queen\u2019s Park Crescent and Grosvenor Street in Toronto.\u000a\u000aEach anniversary, police officers, families and friends gather at the Ontario Police Memorial for the annual Ceremony of Remembrance to honour those that have paid the supreme sacrifice in the performance of their duty.\u000a\u000aToday, the names of 234 fallen officers in the province are inscribed on the Wall of Honour.\u000a\u000aGo to the listed coordinates and do two quick calculations to get the location of the final stage.\u000a\u000a1.  Take the year that Cst Timothy C. Pomeroy from Middlesex County died, divide it by 1000 and add it to the following N co-ordinate: \u000a43 37.897.\u000a\u000a2.  Take the year the Cst Herbert M. Smart from the Toronto RCMP died, divide it by 1000 and add it to the following W co-ordinate: \u000a079 21.373.

VIn March 2002, an ammo box geocache called The Fort\u000a<a rel="nofollow"\u000ahref="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC46BE">GC46BE</a>\u000awas hidden in the woods by Xas. It was archived in August, 2006\u000aafter 183 finds. Acting on a tip, I found The Fort in March 2009. I\u000ahave rehidden this cache in the same area using its original ammo\u000abox as The Fort Returns! \u000a<p>Please use the parking coordinates. There is no access from Fort\u000aHenry. Parking is near the marina, just down the road from the\u000aplayground and splashpark.</p>\u000a<p>There are two trails which both lead to the cache...they\u000aconnect...no need to bushwack, just follow the trail. Please stick\u000ato the trail and you won't be disappointed. No bushwacking\u000arequired. The cache is an easy stroll (about 250m from parking)\u000aalong a scenic trail. However, the trail follows the top of a\u000acliff, so use caution, especially when slippery. Because of the\u000aproximity to the cliff, this cache is not recommended for small\u000akids or night caching.</p>\u000a<p>There is an alternate path easily seen heading west from the\u000aparking coordinates. This alternate path is more suitable for dogs\u000aand children, but not nearly as scenic. Both paths connect, so if\u000ayou hike in one way, consider continuing along the trail to hike\u000athe full loop (about a half km hike). No bushwacking required,\u000aplease stay on the trails.</p>\u000a<p>Nearby are two excellent playgrounds, arrowhead beach, plenty of\u000agreenspace, and a small splashpark which is open all summer (free).\u000aKids and dogs will really enjoy this area.</p>\u000a<p>I was tempted to hide the cache in one of the many dangerous\u000anooks of the cliff, but chose instead a simple hide close to the\u000atrail. Please be careful near the cliffs. Please use any available\u000acamo to rehide the cache.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a><br />\u000aCongratulations FTF - GlenburnieHawkeye</center>

VThis is a path near the Logan Temple. It has some very pretty park benches nearby that overlook both the Temple and the island. From this view, you'd almost think there was no houses down on the island. All you can see is lots of trees, especially in the spring and summer. The path is one of many that locals use for scenic hikes and walks. No need to go all the way down to the water.\u000a\u000aChanged difficulty to 3 due to difficulty of GPS's getting accurate coordinates on hillside. \u000a\u000aCongrats to dfly57 for the FTF!!

VA small lock n' lock containing:\u000alog sheets, pencil\u000aa couple small toys \u000aloose change\u000aa toonie for FTF\u000a\u000aWhen this cache was originally placed an off-leash dog area was not here. Now there is, left the cache there but having a dog with you might make things easier.\u000a\u000aThis park located by the lake has parking and is quite nice.\u000aCan see planes leaving/landing at Island airport, lots of boats around as well. Many dogs and muggles as usual though.\u000aClimbing of trees is unnecessary, it is not that high up.\u000a \u000aThe park had a mass tree planting effort over 70 yrs. ago.\u000aMostly silver maples are found with the odd oak;  among others.\u000a\u000aPretty easy to find cache, the main challenge is putting cache back hidden from muggles.\u000aPlease take care putting cache back so it remains hidden. Thanks!\u000a\u000aNov. 28th, 2009 went by location and now the cache is in a very large gated off-leash dog area. Nice if you have a dog, but may increase the muggle factor. Closed from midnight until 6am.\u000a\u000a\u000aFTF to emzernask, congrats

VThe red brick Gooderham Building (commonly referred to as the Flatiron Building) at 49 Wellington Street East in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is located on the eastern edge of the city's financial district (east of Yonge Street), on the north side of the Front Street (St. Lawrence) neighbourhood wedged between Front Street and Wellington Street, where they join up to form a triangular intersection. Although a prominent landmark both for its colour and shape, it is only five storeys high. It is also the first known flatiron building in a major city, completed in 1892. The English-American Building in Atlanta was completed in 1897, and the Fuller Building in New York City was completed in 1902.\u000a\u000aThe previous building was shorter but in the same shape and was called the Coffin Block. The current building was built by architect David Roberts, Jr. and originally cost $18,000 to construct for distiller George Gooderham, son of the founder William Gooderham. It was the office of the Gooderham & Worts distillery until 1952 and sold by the Gooderham Estate in 1957.\u000a\u000aIt is well-known both for its narrow wedge shape, and for the mural on its back wall, which uses a trompe l'oeil effect to not only make the wall appear to have more windows than it does, but to also give it a more mobile effect by having its edges 'fluttering' away where they are not 'tacked' down. The mural, called Trompe.d'oille, was created by renowned Canadian artist Derek Michael Besant. The mural is a picture of the Perkins Building, which is located directly across the street. Saved by David and Thomas Walsh, restoration took place in 1998 by the owners Michael and Anne Tippin. The building was declared a historic site in 1975 and is now managed and owned by Woodcliffe Corporation.\u000a\u000aIn addition to the fine architecture, there is a large patio, and a small pub in the basement. The building is open to view from Monday to Fridays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u000a\u000aShould be an easy cache, except during lunch in the summer!  Many, many, many interested muggles!

VThis is a public park that has four magnificent old willows that have stood the test of time with the winds off Lake Ontario and the many children who have climbed and used its boughs for treasures and in one particular willow, the children in my family placed seashells for wishes. This cache is not in the 'wishing tree' but is in ONE of the THREE willow trees at the waterfront where the coordinates will lead you. Your search and challenge is to figure out WHICH TREE nests the geocache.\u000aPlease note there is absolutely no need to remove any bark, or tree growth in your search. The geocache is easily accessible and to a keen eye, very visible. If you are a geocacher who cannot control their addiction and suffer from manhandling natural plants this cache is NOT FOR YOU.\u000aABSOLUTELY NO NIGHT CACHING and during the day please be careful not to arouse any suspicion or this will be muggled. You will need to bring your own pen/pencil to sign the log.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO WOVENCAMP on their FTF and a really HONOURABLE MENTION to PROCELL \u000a\u000aA VERY SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WOVENCAMP KIDS FOR THEIR  FTF-F  -FIRST TO FIND FOSSILS\u000a\u000aWOO HOO!

VThis cache will be difficult to find surreptitiously, as there are always people about.  They might not be of geocaching stock, but they will watch you and likely pilfer the cache if you are not careful.\u000a\u000aA great pub, some good restaurants and three higher end food emporiums are nearby.\u000a\u000aThe story behind the fountain is that a couple of characters in the neighbourhood, of which there are plenty, emptied a few bottles of dish soap one night into the fountain, which then, of course, erupted and covered the park and the streets with bubbles.\u000a\u000aThe cache is well concealed, but you won't be!  Remember, you are being watched........\u000a\u000aBut you will need a hint for all the interesting people about............

VCache is a micro Lock & Lock container that is easily accessible. I had a hard time getting consistent GPSr readings at GZ. This combined with the usual high muggle activity is the reason for the slightly increased difficulty rating.\u000a\u000aShoal Tower is one of Kingston's Six Martello Towers. The tower, which is located in the water, started being constructed in the winter. The base was built on the ice of Lake Ontario. When the ice melted, the base sank to the bottom of the lake. The water was then pumped out of the base and the walls were constructed. \u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!! \u000a\u000a** Congratulations to "JonAndJaymee" on the FTF **

VThis cache was placed for children, with the intent that if they did not like their happymeal toy, then they would be able to trade it with an unwrapped toy found in the cache. The toys in the cache are from all different series and are for both boys and girls. (Please however, do not take a toy and not leave one, we would like enough toys to be able to switch) This cache was placed with permision for the store manager so there should be no problems retrieving the cache. Hope you enjoy the cache!! There is a free meal coupon for the first to find prize, and some other free item coupons for the runners-up. And please be respectful and only take one coupon per cacher.

VThe geocache is found along the Mallorytown Landing Trail north of the Thousand Islands Parkway where it meets County Road 5. Follow the west leg of the loop north of old River Road.\u000a\u000aThe geocache is in a small, square, rubbermaid tupperware with a clear bottom and a red lid. Inside you will find a tidbit of interpretive information, a log sheet, several golf pencils,and an information sheet about Parks Canada's geocaching guidelines.\u000a\u000aThere are no trade items in the cache and we ask that none be left as they are potential animal attractants. Parks Canada also has a Leave No Trace policy which means that we ask you to leave nothing but footprints and take nothing but photos.

VThe multi-cache is made up of 10 reference points and 1 final all\u000aan easy walk within City Park in downtown Kingston.

VNemo didn't learn from his first little adventure by himself and went and got himself lost again. \u000aHe needs an experienced geocacher to help him get back to his home. \u000aThis experienced geocacher will have more luck if they are using a fish finder GPS! \u000aIf you don't have a fish finder your GPS may still work. Nemo needs to be found soon so that he can be returned to his home once again!

From here follow the trail of\u000areflective yellow tape until you reach another larger strip. The\u000asecond larger strip is where you will find the final cache.

VA short walk down a public trail which goes around Old Fort Henry.\u000a200 years ago, when most travel was by water, this was a strategic\u000alocation of great importance.<br />\u000a<p>There is parking at the top of Fort Henry Hill. Free parking in\u000awinter. When the fort is open (summer months, and Oct/Nov evenings)\u000athere is a $5 parking fee. During Oct/Nov this fee is easily\u000aavoided by visiting during the day (before 6pm) or after 10pm.There\u000ais also free parking at the bottom of Fort Henry Hill near the\u000atourist information center, but it is a long uphill walk. You may\u000afind street parking near the trailhead, but check carefully for\u000asignage to avoid a costly ticket.</p>\u000a<p>Caution!!! There are moats here! Keep dogs and kids on a short\u000aleash until well away from the Fort. The signs which say "no\u000aaccess" mean that there is no entry to the fort from the trail. You\u000aare allowed down this public path, just be careful of the moats.\u000aThe trail to GZ is bike friendly. By bike you can start at the\u000atrailhead, then continue all the way around the fort to exit. This\u000ais a great cache for kids and dogs, with the exception of the\u000adanger due to moats.</p>\u000a<p>From the trailhead, step over the low chain and continue down\u000athe grassy path being careful of the moat to your left. Follow this\u000apath until you can turn down the groomed grass hill toward GZ\u000awithout bushwhacking.</p>\u000a<p>When the Fort is "closed", the grounds are usually still open to\u000athe public. If the doors near the trailhead are open, feel free to\u000awander in and explore inside the Fort on your own.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

V<strong>This cache is intended to be done at night with as many\u000apeople and as many flashlights as possible for maximum\u000aeffect.</strong><br />\u000a<br />\u000aFrom the posted coordinates if it's dark enough and with your\u000aflashlights assistance you should be able to see a white reflector\u000ajust above head height in a tree. Once you've found the reflector\u000amove forward to that location and again using your flashlight look\u000afor the next reflector and repeat the process. Don't be afraid to\u000amove around slightly if required to see the next stage as leaf and\u000atree cover can affect line of sight in some cases. I've spaced the\u000areflectors roughly 15-20m apart so if you travel much more than\u000athat without seeing the next redirect it's probably best to return\u000ato the last known reflector and search again in case you've missed\u000aone of the few turns on the route. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<strong>You're going to continue moving from reflector to reflector\u000auntil you see a tree with 3 reflectors. This is your ground zero\u000awhere the cache is located. Good luck.</strong><br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe cache route is roughly 315m from the posted coordinates and\u000awill require multiple course changes enroute to the cache. Once\u000ayou've found the cache, signed the log and made your trades there's\u000aa few options for returning safely to the posted coordinates and\u000ayour vehicle. One option is you'll notice that the white reflectors\u000ayou followed to the cache location are red reflectors on the\u000areverse side. You could take the reverse route and with your\u000aflashlights follow the red reflectors back to the posted\u000acoordinates.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFor safety do not geocache alone at night. Groups with a minimum of\u000atwo adults are recommended. No one enjoys flashlights at night like\u000akids (and I do) so I've marked the cache as kid friendly but please\u000atake care and keep an eye on the kids when walking the trails after\u000adark.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center>Happy Caching!!!</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center><strong>** Congratulations to "astar9 and Friend" on the\u000aFTF **</strong></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>\u000a<img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></center>

VStart at the trailhead and follow the path all the way to the\u000acache. A 10-15 minute walk suitable for older kids and great for\u000adogs (let them off leash if you like). This is an excellent\u000a"technical" mountain bike trail. While walking the trail, watch out\u000afor bikes coming up fast from ahead and behind. The cache is about\u000a10m north of the path.

VCache is located on Wolfe Island.\u000a\u000aWe planted this cache while heading out to Big Sandy Beach to do the 2 caches already located there.\u000aThe idea for this cache is to give you a cache that will bring you to the starting point for the 2 other caches without the walk.\u000a\u000aCache is a camo taped film cannister. Logbook only. BYOP\u000a\u000aDuring the summer season this maybe a busy place so please use stealth.

VThe cache is approximately one meter off of the road on Gigi's property which is located on Cartwright Point.  The Point is a small piece of private land surrounded on one side by CFB Kingston and Lake Ontario on the other - sort of a rose between two thorns.  \u000a\u000aI would take heed of the speed limit while driving through base.  There\u2019s quite often a MP with radar sitting around.\u000a\u000aYou can park on Canal du Nord but \u201cNEED\u201d to be on Mallard Lane to get to the cache.  You\u2019ll be close to it when you see the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign - you won\u2019t be if you\u2019re close to the shed.  We'd also prefer that you didn't cache after 9 pm so you don't freak-out the neighbours.  \u000a\u000aSo in a nut shell;\u000aNo late night caching\u000aA meter off the road (Mallard Lane)\u000aLook for the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign and you'll be close\u000aBe gentle\u000aThink of the hint\u000a\u000aHappy caching...\u000a\u000aCongrats to Spannah & Skottikus for your FTF...

VSo a funny thing happened to me when I was out on Whiskey Island the other day (15 Dec)...\u000a\u000aWhile doing up the caches on Cedar I thought I'd replace Hamburking's lost cache on Whiskey Island. Unfortunately it was considered too close to one of the caches I was putting on Cedar...\u000a\u000aSo when I went to retrieve the cache that I had left hanging in the last bush on the western tip of the island, I stumbled across Hamburking's Risky Whiskey Business laying in some tall grass about 20 feet or so away from its original hiding spot.\u000a\u000aAfter a few emails back and forth we agreed that he should find his own cache with all of the original content.\u000a\u000aI'll say, "enjoy" but doubt that you will especially come spring, or summer and perhaps fall.\u000a\u000aThe cache is located on city property, south west of the Kingston SPCA. Prior to placing the cache I spoke with the Animal Control Officer and he had no problems with people walking around the trails south of their building because while they've been using the field for over 18 years (use the satellite view) - it doesn't belong to them. Their property stops at their driveway.  \u000a\u000aThe terrain can be anywhere from somewhat to very wet around the cache. I would definitely wear rubber boots come spring. There will be some required bushwhacking as you get close to the cache.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations Coman123 on your FTF and your new toque.

VThis cache was previously placed at Wartman House at the green birdhouse but had to be relocated due to the saturation. This morning when I went to retrieve it the poor little thing had been chewed to small bits by what I am sure were squirrels. So I camo'd the container and made a wee little camo'd tag to open the log book so it would have a better chance of survival. The container is placed at a common, very high traffic walk through so stealth is paramount. Please bring your own writing utensil and be very careful with the opening and closing of the logbook. The camo fabric is to cover the log and re-seal the cache. Please feel free to RAISE THE BAR for the hide if you feel it may be in a "compromising position.\u000aMerry Christmas and I hope you get this before the SQUIRREL CHEW-ers come back.\u000aEnjoy the number.

VWARNING: If you are in haste to snatch a cache and break limbs or damage trees this cache is NOT for you. \u000a\u000aThe cache container is attached by a bungee cord to a limb that the seeker MUST  VERY, VERY GENTLY LIFT from the height away from the big tall tree. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT REMOVE THE CONTAINER FROM THE BUNGEE CORD. DO not remove the container from the limb.\u000a\u000aNO NIGHT TIME CACHING because there will be no way in darkness to determine the NON-LIVING CACHE limb from the actual LIVING LIMBS. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not do this cache at nighttime. \u000a\u000aThis cache is hidden within the wetland conservation area land that was donated by DuPont Canada many years ago, It is very popular with dogwalkers and birders. During the change of the seasons the terrain difficulty will increase with the wetlands becoming more wet,winter time can cause slippery, icy trails and heavy snowfall combined with wicked biting north winds which can make walking much more strenuous. The winds really blow across this area in the winter so be advised to choose your visit and plan ahead.\u000aThe day I placed the cache there were families skating on the river just across from the hide, there was no wind and it was really wonderful... so please..come to enjoy the walk...and use stealth when you go for the hide because dog walkers tend to come out of nowhere and I would not wish the cache to be compromised.\u000a\u000aThe cache container is attached to a limb by a bungee cord. To retrieve the cache you will have to determine WHICH limb is the one that will BRING THE CACHE DOWN TO YOU. There is no need to climb any trees and I do not recommend it because it is a conservation area and we need the trees for the wildlife. This area is also a nesting area so please respect the area. Leave only your footprints...or a nice geotrail of confounding overtones.\u000aEnjoy the walk in and I wish all cachers a fun time with the hide.

VJust a quick little thank you to Bluesaway in appreciation for\u000ahosting yet another, her fourth event. This is typical of one who\u000ais willing to drop what she&rsquo;s doing at a moment&rsquo;s\u000anotice to make time for geocaching friends. Bluesaway has always\u000abeen a very integral member of the Kingston Area Geocachers. When\u000anot trying to steal Jax away from his owner, her smiling face can\u000abe seen in many group shots mugging it up at GZ, most often in\u000aconnection with FTFs. Since she began geocaching she has made as\u000amany friends as she has finds and considering her stats the\u000aachievement is considerable. Besides her many and varied cache\u000ahides, for which she is the proud winner of one of\u000aCacheDrone&rsquo;s first geocoins, Bluesaway can boast the singular\u000ahonour of being the very first KAG to reach, on June 14, 2008, the\u000aall-important millennium find; then she sped up the pace!<br />\u000a<center><font color="red">(Do NOT access from hwy.

Yeah, the water is\u000afollowing the trail down the hill &amp; finding it's own way into\u000aDeroche Lake.

V<p>Walking along the trail it started to feel like the forest had\u000anumerous eyes that were following us along the path. The forest's\u000aeyes were a cold, pale blue and at times everywhere we looked an\u000aeye was looking directly at us.</p>\u000a<p>As we went along we came face to face with a tree with its two\u000apale eyes wide open and looking very intently at us. It seemed to\u000abe wondering what we were doing in this dark corner of its forest.\u000aSo, we thought, it would be a good idea to give this forest\u000asentinel a reason for our intrusion into its territory and decided\u000ato drop a cache nearby that it could guard for us.</p>

V<p>We headed out to look for a few caches further along this trail\u000awhen we came to a small pond. It was a pretty spot and we took some\u000apictures and stayed a few minutes to enjoy it,</p>\u000a<p>As we stood on the edge of the pond, there was suddenly a loud\u000arustling noise and the sound of wings flapping. A great blue heron\u000aflew by just a few feet in front and just above head height. It was\u000aclear that the heron hadn't come from the pond the where were\u000astanding.</p>\u000a<p>So we did some hunting around to see where the heron could have\u000acome from. We came to a few large pines where the pond turned\u000asharply to the south. From this spot we could see the lost lagoon\u000ain this distance. The lagonn hadn't been visible from the nearby\u000atrail but there it was and the wildlife clearly liked it.</p>\u000a<p>This cache, placed as part of COG Spring Fling, was put here to\u000ashow you this lagoon. You can get to the cache by only going about\u000a10m off the trail. Please try to take the shortest route to the\u000acache.</p>

V<p>The edge of the forest can often be one of the more interesting\u000aareas to search. The trees get sparser, eventually becoming just\u000asingle trees in a stand and then the open grassy areas start.</p>\u000a<p>Because they can be seen as total trees, single trees standing\u000aat the edge can be quite beautiful with their symmetry so evident.\u000aExcept, if you look very closely at some of these nearly perfect\u000a(at least from a distance) specimens, you can see that there are\u000aactually two trees here and there are two tops instead of one, like\u000atwin peaks.</p>\u000a<p>You are looking for one of these twin peaks and the challenge is\u000anot just to find the cache here but to see if you can see the\u000ashorter of the two peaks. Its actually quite hard to see.</p>

V<p>This might happen if a tree was sucked too dry to make maple\u000asyrup. Of course, they don't do that and syrup makers are very\u000acareful to take care of their trees, They want them to live well\u000aand for a very long time.</p>\u000a<p>But looking at this spot, I was thinking that if I was a tree,\u000athis might be my nightmare.</p>

VI have been keeping an eye on the development of this "extension" to a trail system and thought when the major work was complete I would like to place a cache along its path to bring people out to view and walk and enjoy.\u000a\u000aThe cache is just off the trail in a wooded area but abuts the property of a townhouse rental area. There are SOMETIMES children playing nearby and lots of muggles to speak of. I have spoken to the renters along Portsmouth Avenue to inform them of a geocache being placed along this trail as a COURTESY to them due to the nature of a geocache hunt by people that could alarm a judicious cautious parent who has children playing in the backyards along the trail.\u000a\u000aPLEASE DO NOT NIGHT CACHE THIS CACHE and if you feel that your presence AT ANY TIME while geocaching COULD OR MIGHT BE  PERCEIVED IN ANY WAY AS A CONCERN TO PERSONS WHO LIVE ALONG THE PROPERTY BACKING ONTO THE TRAIL, DISCONTINUE YOUR SEARCH AND COME BACK AGAIN...or don't do the cache at all.\u000a\u000aAs with any geocache search, leave no footprints or signs of your visit but do sign the log for a smiley for stealth and careful caching.\u000a\u000aFTF prize is bragging rights to finding the cache and NOT being noticed by ANY person or thing along this new trail.\u000a\u000a(Note: Upper caps are used for EMPHASIS*)\u000a\u000a\u000aCongratulations to jack2u on FTF and Number One in Stealth and Eco-friendly walking! Cheers

VDowntown Kingston has lots to see and do. Find the cache, and enjoy\u000athe sights and sounds of Kingston.\u000a<p>The cache is a small clear container, well marked as a geocache.\u000aHowever, it is well camo'd. You only need your eyes to search and\u000afind this hide. It is hidden in plain view. GZ is a very public\u000aarea with muggles all around. Once you spot the cache, grab the\u000ahandle (you'll know it when you see it) and lift straight up. Then\u000aplease walk away from GZ to open and log.</p>\u000a<p>You will also need this IMPORTANT information so that the camo\u000ais not damaged when you open the cache container: HOW TO OPEN A PB\u000aJAR - Grab the GREEN LID firmly with one hand, and twist the clear\u000abody of the jar with the other. Please do not twist the camo. Allow\u000afuture cachers to enjoy this hide by handling the container and\u000acamo carefully. To return the cache, please be sure to allign it so\u000athat it rests fully in it's hiding spot.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com" target=\u000a"_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000aborder="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

VAn easy cache north of downtown Kingston. This is the first geocache we have hidden, so we have placed it in a spot that is easy for us to keep an eye on... at our house. Our 3 year old son has just started geocaching and would love to keep track of a 'treasure' at his very own home. We have named the cache in honour of the bugs which frequent the site of our cache.\u000a\u000aFeel free to have a seat on the step while you look for our cache. This is a medium sized tupperware container suitable for small 'treasures', geocoins, etc. \u000a\u000aFeel free to snap a picture with the cache and post it online, our son would love to see that people are actually finding his treasure!

VIn Kingston the word "beach" does not mean sand. This beach is\u000arocky. <br />\u000aWATERSHOES are strongly recommended. There are sharp stones when\u000aentering/exiting the water. \u000a<p>No boat or special equipment required. Water shoes strongly\u000aadvised. The steps and rocks are really slippery, use caution. For\u000asafety, never swim alone.</p>\u000a<p>The adjacent "Bath House" (change rooms) is open Victoria Day to\u000aLabour Day, Mon-Fr 8-8, Sat-Sun 12-8.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is a watertight container attached to a chain with a\u000acaribiner. Undo the biner to release the cache. A second, smaller\u000acontainer is permanently attached to the chain as a float, so that\u000ayou can find the chain (and caribiner) again after signing the log\u000aashore. The float is not as bouyant as I'd hoped, so remember where\u000athe chain is located. The water levels fluxuate over the summer.\u000aWhen I hid the cache, the levels were "high", and the depth was\u000aabout 6 feet (2m). The chain is attached to a cement block, which\u000ais a handy thing to stand on while clipping/unclipping the cache.\u000aLower water levels will make the cache easier to find.</p>\u000a<p>Coords are good within 2m, plenty of clear sky here. Many GPS\u000aare splashproof, but not waterproof, so be careful with your GPS.\u000aAlthough big waves can be fun, they make this cache much harder to\u000afind. Enjoy the adventure, have fun, and please play safe.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a> \u000a<p>A great First to Find by whovencamp and gwbbh!\u000aCongratulations!</p></center>

VA short walk down a public trail which goes around Old Fort Henry. 200 years ago, when most travel was by water, this was a strategic location of great importance.  Good access to the cache if approaching by water (kayak/canoe).\u000a\u000aPARKING INFO: When the fort is OPEN (summer months, and Oct/Nov evenings) there is a $5 parking fee. The fee ONLY applies when the fort is open, which is (summer) 9:30am-4:30pm daily, plus event evenings (usually sat and wed).  To avoid the parking fee, simply visit outside of those hours. During Oct/Nov this fee is easily avoided by visiting during the day (before 6pm) or after 10pm.   Free parking all winter. There is free parking at the bottom of Fort Henry Hill near the tourist information center, but it is a very long uphill walk. You may find street parking near the trailhead and alternate trailhead, but check carefully for signage to avoid a costly ticket.  \u000a\u000aThe best way to visit this cache is by bike!  No fees anytime!  Bikes should follow the road behind the fort to the alternate trailhead for an easy and enjoyable ride to GZ.\u000a\u000aCaution!!! There are moats here! Keep dogs and kids on a short leash until well away from the Fort. The signs which say "no access" mean that there is no entry to the fort from the trail. You are allowed down this public path, just be careful of the moats. The trail to GZ is bike friendly. By bike you can start at the trailhead, then continue all the way around the fort to exit at the alternate trailhead. This is a great cache for kids and dogs, with the exception of the danger due to moats.\u000a\u000aFrom the trailhead, step over the low chain and continue down the grassy path being careful of the moat to your left. Follow this path until you can turn down the groomed grass hill toward GZ without bushwhacking.\u000a\u000aWhen the fort is open, it is best to use the alternate trailhead.\u000a\u000aWhen the Fort is "closed", the interior grounds are usually still open to the public. If the doors near the trailhead are open, feel free to wander in and explore inside the Fort on your own.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000aAT2ARW8 - Althernate Trailhead\u000aN 44° 13.748 W 076° 27.567\u000aAn alternate trailhead. Take the long way round the Fort. There are a few parking spots at this trailhead, but you can only drive there if the gate is open. This road is not plowed in winter. This trailhead may be better for kids and dogs, since you drive over the moat before you park, and the walk is less steep. If you are walking to this trailhead from the main parking area, be aware that you will cross a big dangerous moat which is not visible from a distance.\u000aST2ARW8 - Trailhead\u000aN 44° 13.836 W 076° 27.638\u000aThe Trailhead. Step over the low chain near the entrance to the fort, and follow the grassy path. Use caution, there is a real moat on your left. Hang on to kids and dogs. This is a public path. The chain is only to help direct crowds into the fort. Just follow the path.\u000a

VThe final is in a beautiful little spot where you can sit on the rocks and see Fort Henry, Deadman Bay and the City of Kingston.  There's also a picnic table at the final should you require its services.  Parks Canada has gone to considerable efforts to enable this cache and will be turning a social trail which visitors are discouraged from using into an official trail in the spring.  \u000a\u000aThere are a total of 16 Martello Towers built in British North America: (5) Halifax, (1) Saint John, (4) Quebec City and (6) Kingston. Eleven survive including all six in Kingston.\u000a\u000aThe first two towers were built as part of Fort Henry. The moats leading downwards from the fort to the water were intended to make it difficult for attacking forces to completely surround the fort. These moats end at towers on the waterfront. The walls of these towers are thinner on the side of the fort to make it easier to destroy the towers in case they fell to the invaders.\u000a\u000aThe other four larger towers were built from 1846 to 1848 during a period of heightened border tensions with the United States and were the most complex of the Martello Towers. The roofs were designed to fall away easily to expose from one to three cannons.\u000a\u000aThe four largest towers from east to west are: Cathcart Redoubt on Cedar Island, Fort Frederick at the Royal Military College, Victoria Battery or Shoal Tower in front of City Hall and Murney Tower.\u000a    \u000aTwo of the towers, Murney Tower and Fort Frederick, are open to the public and contain museums. Murney Tower is managed by Parks Canada. Fort Frederick houses the Royal Military College Museum.  Be sure to try, "KAM #3 Murney Tower - GC1DTV5" when it's open for the summer season.\u000a\u000aAccording to John Robert Colombo's book, "Mysteries of Ontario" there is said to be a ghost of a beautiful young woman named Elizabeth who watches over Deadman Bay in search of her lost fiancée who drowned on 12 Sep 1846.  While I haven't seen her myself, the vantage point from Ground Zero gives you the best view of the whole bay so you'll probably be standing where she normally looks out.\u000a\u000aA year later during construction of the Cathcart Redoubt, a group of 23 workers were returning home from Cedar Island across Hamilton Cove. A heavy swell caused the overloaded boat to capsize. Two swam to safety. Another four survived by clinging to the overturned boat. But 17 died. As a result, the waters between Cedar Island and Point Henry was renamed Deadman Bay.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to scale down the cliffs or to do any bushwhacking of any kind to find the cache. I would remind people with children and those who might want to find this in winter to be extremely careful around ledges and on the ice.\u000a\u000aThe cache's co-ordinates will take you to the Cathcart Redoubt where you'll find a small container under a tree containing the co-ordinates to the final.  \u000a\u000aWhile it's Parks Canada policy that geocaches on their property contain no swag, they did allow me to leave a Starbucks card for the FTF.\u000a\u000aStay Safe and Happy Caching...\u000a\u000a\u000aVery well done - Congratulations on your FTF CanadianZombie and Binrat.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VThe island, is located just across Deadman Bay from historic Fort Henry and is the home of the Cathcart Martello Tower, one of the four largest in Kingston out of a total of six towers built in the 1840s to protect Kingston's harbour and the entrance to the Rideau Canal. \u000a\u000aWhen the St. Lawrence Islands National Park was established in 1904, there were a number of buildings located on the islands of local historical interest.  The gazebos on Gordon Island, West Grenadier Island and at Mallorytown Landing were built as picnic shelters soon after the park was established and are among the oldest structures of their type in a Canadian National Park.  \u000a\u000aWhile I could find very little information on the Cedar Island gazebo, it still make for a great place to sit and enjoy the breeze on a hot afternoon while looking out towards Wolfe Island and its windmills.\u000a\u000aAs for any cache that is surrounded by water, caution and common sense are required. There are currents and heavy boat traffic in the summer and unpredictable ice conditions during the winter in this location.\u000a\u000aBecause of the very heavy boat traffic I recommend that you NOT swimming from the mainland. During the summer months you can rent a variety of sailing/paddling/rowing watercraft in downtown Kingston to get you there safely (Google boat or canoe rentals).\u000a\u000aThe cache is a black painted water bottle containing no swag as per Parks Canada policy.\u000a\u000aEnjoy your stay and remember to leave nothing behind.\u000a\u000aCongratulations on your FTF CanadianZombie and Binrat - and thanks for inviting me along on your adventure...\u000a\u000aAnd a big Congratulations to "catandmatt" on their 1st ever geocache find!!!!

The area is a nice spot for a rest, or a view of the water, or for the kids to play on the playground set.  There is a path in the area so be careful of geomugglers!!

VWelcome to Adventures in Guntape 1. My clan's first laid cache. A peanutbutter jar coated in Guntape (DuctTape in civvie land) along with a hand drawn camo scheme. An easy find for those starting into the geo-caching world. \u000a\u000aThis cache is proof once again that guys out caching with their wives should listen to them.  As I was bushwhacking trying to find a decent spot and getting frustrated at lack of spots, Karen quickly pointed out that I should look in the area where she was standing which was a fair distance from me. Well, I finally caved in and in seconds she had pointed out the spot that became the caches new home. So gents, when the spouse/significant other speaks - you listen.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS  to Skottikus on the FTF.

Please keep the animals hidden, they don't want to be discovered!\u000a\u000aUPDATE:  The owner of the property is aware the cache is here!

VAs many people know I'm in Kingston because I'm a student at Queen's, but over the past couple years I have learnt many things outside of the classroom. Geocaching is one of those. As it is nearing the end of the school year and seeing as I'm being tested on everything else I've learnt all year, I decided to put out a cache that reflects what I've learnt about geocaching in the last year. A final exam for Geocaching 101 if you will - I hope I pass!\u000a\u000aIt wouldn't be a good tribute if it didn't start with a puzzle, but I promise it's easy. I've included hints for every stage of the cache, so it should not be too difficult. \u000a\u000aPuzzle starts below:\u000a\u000aZpv ctg rq csyv bfd. Zu nla abizbml, px dy yzces radfk sbhe cbs iwgtt tej knf kap yhnk. Qymn nzqzi oet qeobb mlc onhms zero uisff hkxg dqg xli kzs corr ilnpu.

At the time, I thought I was being clever and was quite\u000asurprised to see how quickly some members of KAG were able to crack\u000ait. Yet others seemed to have a difficult time with it. So this is\u000aanother attempt to see if it can do a good job of hiding a\u000acache...</p>

VCache is on Wolfe Island I placed the cach here while I was caching. This is also part 4 of my FTF race.\u000a\u000aIt will be a good time to pick up the other caches that are over here. Also bring a picnic lunch with you as there are tables near the cach with a great view of the Kingston across the lake.\u000a\u000a~*~*~GONGRADS TO COMAN123 ON THE FTF ~*~*~*~

VWelcome to the Ravensview area of Kingston!\u000a\u000aThis little known park is often used by local residents to walk their dogs (thus there may be muggle activity).  Despite the partial pavement pad, do [b]NOT[/b] drive into the park itself.  You can park on the street opposite the park entrance or a short walk away at 44°14.289N 076°25.654W.\u000a\u000aYou will probably need scuba gear for this cache unless you're really, really good at measuring surface-swimming distances.  You will need underwater navigational skills, such as following a straight-line bearing and measuring distances underwater (by counting fin kicks, usually).  Also, [b]bring a dive slate.[/b]\u000a\u000aDepth seems to be pretty uniformly 15-18' over a silt/sand/huge-limestone-block bottom.  Weed growth can make seeing the bottom a challenge in places [;)]\u000a\u000a[b]Hauling a dive float/flag during this dive is highly advisable[/b] due to pleasure craft activity in the area.\u000a\u000aFind the instruction micro above, which contains "cheater" coordinates, or follow these directions:\u000a\u000a1. Start at the flat rock at 44°14.300N 076°25.585W.\u000a2. On a bearing of 160°, swim for 280'.  There should be a marker at approximately this location.\u000a3. At or near the marker (or not ?) shoot a bearing of 70° and swim for 265'.\u000a4. When you get near your destination, it may be helpful to perform a search.  You'll know it when you find it (there should be a tennis-ball marker at your destination as well)\u000a\u000aMany thanks to Jeff from Rockport Dive Center for his loan of tools and donation of FTF prize for this cache!\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VDuring the winter, Wolfe Island's usual ferry dock freezes over due\u000ato the shallow water and the sheltered bay. Because of this, the\u000aferry has an alternate docking location in the winter for people to\u000atravel to and from the island. In the summer, though, this can seem\u000alike a very lonely place.<br />\u000a<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/4aae2c0f-e688-4293-a54e-cad49322f8c8.jpg"\u000a     border="0" alt="Loading Ramp"\u000a     title="Loading Ramp" />

Extreme stealth will be required. \u000a\u000aCache is located at the summer ferry dock. Makes a great launching point for your island cache adventure.\u000a\u000aAt the time this cache was listed Wolfe Island now boasts over 40 caches, so come on over for a visit and get a pile of smileys in your logbook.

VAnother Restin' series cache located in a cemetery on Wolfe Island that up until a week ago I had no idea was here.\u000a\u000aCache is a camo taped film container. BYOP.\u000a\u000aI was not sure of the name of the cemetery, but Jevre provided the name for me.\u000a\u000aMost of the dates I could see are all in the 1800's early 1900's. This is a very well maintained old cemetery.\u000a\u000aThe trick to getting to this cache is finding the one and only way to it. You can see this cache behind the school on Hwy 95. However you are not permitted to access the cache from this direction.\u000a\u000aPlease heed the NO TRESPASSING sign behind the school and find the correct route\u000a\u000aI am not sure if the way in is maintained in the winter.

VThis is a tough find. I will tell you exactly where it is and how\u000ato get it, and it is still very tough.<br />\u000aYou will need a boat, boating skills, and be a good underwater\u000aswimmer. You won't need any special dive gear. \u000a<p>The water east of Simcoe Island is shallow with a smooth\u000aclay/sand bottom. Some locals call this area "half a beach". The\u000ashore side is entirely private property, there is no access from\u000ashore, you may not go ashore, strictly enforced! GZ must be\u000aapproached by boat. The bay is protected from the south and west,\u000aso there is usually flat water there, excellent for swimming in the\u000asummer.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is on the bottom of the lake, in about 2 metres of\u000awater (6 feet deep). It is a large metal box, clearly marked as a\u000ageocache. Do not try to lift it, it's filled with cement and is\u000areally heavy. The box is held shut with a clasp (like for a\u000apadlock), but instead of a lock there is a caribiner. You must undo\u000athe caribiner to open the box. Inside the box is a red watertight\u000acontainer held in place on a short chain, attached with another\u000acaribiner. You must undo this caribiner to release the cache and\u000atake it to the surface.</p>\u000a<p>Since the box is in only 2m of water, no special diving\u000aequipment is required. Goggles or a mask will help seeing the\u000acaribiners. Once you get to the posted coords, the box should be\u000avisible from the surface. The logbook is a sheet of paper, inside a\u000ayellow waterproof tube, inside the red cache container. Please try\u000ato keep the log dry. There is space for small swag.</p>\u000a<p>On summer weekends, this area is packed with powerboats enjoying\u000athe clear cool waters of Lake Ontario.</p>\u000a<p>CONGRATULATIONS MM_DANCER and BLUESAWAY - FIRST TO FIND!!!!</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://kingstongeocaching.com/kag_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>

VA second cache to make the $5 ferry ride to Simocoe Island worth while for cachers.  This is a small island with a pretty view.  The ferry is an experience for anyone who has not travled on a small one, especially on a windy day.  Time it well, cause it only carries 3 cars, but don't worry about a schedule because it arrives when you do, if it isn't there already.

V<p>This cache is based on one of my other hobbies, genealogy.\u000aGenealogy involves identifying ancestral or descendant families by\u000ausing historical records to establish biological, genetic, or\u000afamilial kinship. To date I have 9738 people in my database going\u000aback to 1495. Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Dale of the 93rd.\u000aHighlanders, who lead his troops and was killed in action at New\u000aOrleans on January 8, 1815 (Battle of New Orleans) was a cousin of\u000amine.</p>

V401 and Montreal St. intersection is known as exit 619 which accounts for the name.  There was a cache here quite a while ago that has been archived.  If it is YOUR CHOICE to take the children please keep them close.  The cache location in itself is not dangerous but there is something nearby that requires much caution.  \u000a***DO NOT TRY TO ACCESS THE CACHE FROM THE 401***   There is safe parking just north of the highway at one of those park 'n fly lots.

V<p>The idea for this type of encrypted cache came from\u000aSuperDave_GPS\u2019 \u201cEbg Guvegrra Naq Al Bhed\u201d (GCYV7D) which I enjoyed\u000asolving. I thought it might prove interesting to try something\u000asimilar here in Kingston. The cache is NOT at the posted\u000acoordinates, although it is in the same area. To find the cache,\u000asimply read the write-up below for the dedication and for all the\u000ainformation you will need. Pictures are welcome but of course avoid\u000aspoilers and no geo-mobs please. FTF prize. Enjoy the\u000achallenge.</p>\u000a<p>Ybpd ydi wkgey. Bqkj xpdi fepdyv xp ip.

VDuring the Great Depression, many people found themselves without work or home and resorted to becoming homeless vagabonds, traveling from city to city looking for work.\u000aThe hobos, as they were called, created a series of codes or signs in order to leave secret information for other hobos passing through the area.\u000aI thought that it would be fun to see if modern day geocachers could figure out the symbols.\u000aHead to the posted to find your first sign, and follow them to the cache.\u000aIt might be beneficial to do some research on hobo signs before you start the hunt.\u000aHave fun.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VThis cache is meant to determine just how addicted you are.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aOnce you arrive at the posted coordinates, there is not just one\u000abut FOUR cache containers. They are NOT all at the posted\u000acoordinates. They are within 30 meters of the posted coordinates.\u000aThey each have their own logbook. Each logbook has a number (either\u000a1, 2, 3, or 4) depending on the size of the cache. The biggest\u000acache has the 4, and the smallest has the 1. They are all different\u000asizes.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aTo claim a find, all you have to do is find ANY of the four\u000acontainers, and sign the log AND you must put the number of the\u000acontainer you found in your log online. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aHere is where we find out just how addicted you are:<br />\u000a1) Will you settle with the 4? Or will you need to find the\u000a1?<br />\u000a2) Will you settle with finding just one container, or will you\u000aneed to find all 4?<br />\u000a3) How long will you spend looking? Especially during the\u000aevent?<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAlso, there is four possible FTFs for this cache - one for each\u000acontainer, although in theory they could all go to the same person\u000a(if the same person found all four containers before anyone else\u000adid.)<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFTF List:<br />\u000aContainer 1 - Jevre <br />\u000aContainer 2 - mm_dancer, elsa57, bluesaway <br />\u000aContainer 3 - mm_dancer, elsa57, bluesaway <br />\u000aContainer 4 - skottikus <br /><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VMilton is only accessible by boat. The hardest part of this cache\u000ais getting to Milton Island.\u000a<p>There are docks at the east end of the island, in a protected\u000acove. There is a shelter equipped with benches and a functional\u000awoodstove near the docks. Bathrooms are nearby (follow the signs).\u000aPlan a little extra time to explore and enjoy this awesome\u000aplace!</p>\u000a<p>Starting on the north side of the cove, follow the path along\u000athe north shore heading west. Once you find the cache, continue\u000aalong the path, east, to return to the cove. The path makes a\u000acomplete circle of the island. The terrain rating is due to needing\u000aa boat and navigation skills to get to the island. Once at the\u000aisland, the terrain rating would be 2. It should take less than\u000ahalf an hour to walk the entire path, and you will likely be\u000arewarded with some views of nature which should surely impress.\u000aRare birds often spotted here. Don't try to bushwack across the\u000aisland, please stick to the trail.

V<p>This is the first <a href="http://www.wherigo.com/default.aspx"\u000atarget="_blank">"Wherigo"</a> cache placed in the Kingston Area.\u000aSince "The KACHE" event is the first of what is planned to be an\u000aannual event, I thought it would be cool to have the area's first\u000aWherigo cache published as part of it.</p>\u000a<p>Admittedly, this cache does require special equipment--either a\u000aGPS or GPS-enabled Pocket PC that supports the Wherigo player. I do\u000aknow that a few members of KAG have such devices, and can take\u000aadvantage of this new cache type. However, because of the limited\u000anumber of people with such devices, I <strong><em>strongly\u000aencourage mob finds!</em></strong> I ask that those who have such\u000atechnology get together with cachers who don't. Make this one a\u000asocial outing!</p>\u000a<p><strong>There is a prize for the First to Find, and Second to\u000aFind. Only one prize per 'mob' please--and feel free to share it\u000aaround!</strong></p>\u000a<p>In order to complete this cache, you will first need to download\u000athe Cartridge from\u000a<a href="http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=6ffc20aa-1561-43c0-b982-cb3ed7961928"\u000a   target="_blank">here.</a></p>\u000a<p>After you have completed the cartridge, please save your\u000acartridge, and upload the completed cartridge on the\u000a<a href="http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=6ffc20aa-1561-43c0-b982-cb3ed7961928"\u000a   target="_blank">Wherigo page</a>, in addition to logging your\u000a   find here. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to email\u000a   me through my GC.com profile.

Easiest would seem to be to start at the end\u000aof Rogers Side Road but you can get here from Trillium Drive as\u000awell. Note: If approach from SOUTH, try trailhead shown. Terrain is\u000arelatively easy going with low undergrowth. How long before\u000aKingston grows into this area? Powerline Right-of-Way under\u000aconstruction nearby.

VWe grabbed a number of travel bugs and geocoins at TB Hotels along I-81 and I-95.  Some of them had goals that went in other directions, so we dropped them elsewhere.  But the others either were happy or didn't mind coming to Canada with us (we communicated with the owners, in case of doubt).\u000a\u000aWe've dropped them all into this cache, and we're hoping that the first few cachers to find it will each take one of the trackables with them and move it to a new location.   Don't forget to log your "grab".\u000a\u000aWe've rated the terrain as a "2" because the last meter or two could be a very slippery slope in winter, and the cache could get frozen in place (snow should not be a problem, but ice could be),\u000a\u000aInitial trackables in this cache are:\u000aCLIFFORD the dog from Illinois.  Wants to have picture taken with canine friends\u000aBIG FLY from Michigan.  Wants to travel from cache to cache while avoiding pesticides\u000aDUMBO the elephant from Florida.  Wants to go to places that have circuses\u000aFELIX the cat from Kansas.  Original mission accompished and now happy to visit Canada\u000a"A" Geocoin from North Carolina.  Just wants to travel quickly without resting long in any cache\u000aROAMING RHINO from Ohio.  Just wants to see as many caches as possible\u000aMANGO THE MANTUS from B.C. Wants his picture taken in famous gardens\u000aHELLO KITTY PEZ from Oregon.  Original mission accompished and now just wants to travel\u000aELLANDEL'S SPAIN GC from Georgia.  Wants to visit caches with "south" in their name\u000a\u000aWhen the trackables have been claimed, we'll re-stock the cache with tradable stash.  \u000a\u000aHope you have fun with our holiday offering to KAG, from  Kilroy and his Better Half\u000a\u000aI AM TOLD THAT #1 IN THIS SERIES TENDS TO FREEZE.  IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE OTHER FIND IN THIS SERIES, AND #1 PROVES TO BE UNAVAILABLE UNTIL SPRING, LOG YOUR FIND(S) THEN SEND ME AN E-MAIL REQUESTING THE COORDS FINAL.\u000a\u000aCONGRATS TO CANADIAN ZOMBIE FOR THE FIRST TO FINISH THIS SERIES.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

On June 27, 2007, the Rideau Canal was inscribed as a\u000aUNESCO World Heritage Site.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aIn the Rideau area, the most recent period of glaciations (the\u000aWisconsin Period) first took hold about 90,000 years ago, and ended\u000aabout 13,000 years ago. As the ice retreated, the landscape\u000aunderwent progressive changes. Thirteen thousand (13,000) years\u000aago, the whole region, including present day Lake Ontario was under\u000aice. Twelve thousand (12,000) years ago, Lake Iroquois covered most\u000aof the Rideau region, stretching all the way north to Ottawa.\u000aChanges continued, driven to a large degree by isostatic rebound.\u000aNow that the weight of the ice was gone, the land was rising. By\u000a6,000 years ago isostatic rebound was complete and the region\u000aresembled much like it does in present day.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe Rideau Lakes region rock formations consists of Precambrian\u000alimestone (marble), gneiss, quartzite, granulite, migmatite and\u000agranitic (quartz monzonite) plutons. These rocks are overlain in\u000amany parts by more recent, Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks. The\u000aPrecambrian rocks in the Rideau region form part of what is known\u000aas the "Frontenac Axis", a narrow section of the Canadian Shield\u000athat links the Laurentian Plateau with the Adirondack Mountains of\u000aNew York.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aIn the Kingston area, the main types of rock formations that exist\u000aare limestone, gneiss. Limestone is soft and has been eroded more\u000adeeply than other rocks, and therefor forms the basins for most of\u000athe large lakes of the region. In many areas it is almost pure\u000acalcium carbonate, although inclusions are very common. Gneiss is a\u000ageneric descriptive term for a metamorphic rock with discontinuous\u000avisible layering (foliation) which occurs when groups of platy or\u000aelongate grains in separate lenses or streaks. It will often have\u000adifferential colouring with alternating streaks/bands of light and\u000adark minerals. In the Rideau Lakes region it is the most abundant\u000arock after crystalline limestone. The quarrying of limestone from\u000athe region, and its use in buildings throughout Kingston, is what\u000agives the city the name \u201cThe Limestone City\u201d.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<p align="center">The above information was written and published\u000aby Mr. Ken Watson, who gave his approval for his material to be\u000aused for this Earthcache.</p>\u000a<br />\u000aTo log this cache you must complete the following:<br />\u000a<br />\u000a1.

V<p>The cache <b>is</b> on private property, but we own the place,\u000aso that's OK. It's not far from the road. It's a smaller ammo box\u000awith a few goodies:</p>\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>A Macanudo cigar cutter</li>\u000a<li>LCBO guide to classic beers booklet</li>\u000a<li>Retractable telephone cord for a laptop</li>\u000a<li>Home Depot carpenter's pencil</li>\u000a<li>Extra pens for geocachers who forgot theirs</li>\u000a<li>Extra ziplock in case of leakage.</li>\u000a<li>Logbook, pen and transportation schedule</li></ul>\u000a<p>On a nice day, you can expect to see white-tail deer (the local\u000apopulation approaches 100), wild turkey (another 100 or so), any\u000anumber of birds (swallows, heron, snipe) and garter snakes aplenty\u000a(there's a hibernation den within a stone's throw). We'll be back\u000ato add a travel bug later.</p>\u000a<p><b>Seasonal Note:</b> The ferry to Simcoe Island <i>shuts\u000adown</i> for the Winter. After freeze-up, anyone still wishing to\u000alog this cache will have to cross the ice on their own. There are a\u000anumber of permanent residents on the island, so once you get across\u000athe road will be cleared. From the ferry dock to the cache, I\u000aimagine it would be a nice cross-country ski, but I haven't tried\u000athat yet.</p>\u000a<p><b>Wildlife notes:</b> Upon doing our annual cache maintebance\u000avisit, it's become apparent that a number of deer like the\u000aimmediate surroundings as a bed. Watch out for "calling cards".\u000a:P</p>

VTHE IDEA:\u000aThe level of intensity and degree of obsession among geocachers with the race for \u2018First To Find\u2019 status has caused me no end of amusement. Geocachers are hooked to their internet lifeline awaiting the next flash bulletin announcing the newest hide in their area. Thereupon, all else is immediately dropped and the mad dash is on. Well, this set of caches is my response to this phenomenon. Frustration will almost certainly result from the attempt to seek several far-flung caches simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE RACE:\u000aThere have appeared nine individual FTF Frustration micro caches, numbered 1 to 9, that are hidden near and far. They are to be treated as individual caches, not as a multicache. Those not interested in \u201cthe race\u201d may choose to find any of these caches at a more sedate pace (recommended) and enjoy the scenery along the way. In order to be eligible for the FTF prize though, you must find all nine and submit to all the requirements. Read the descriptions and difficulty ratings carefully. Not all caches are kid-friendly. Frustration is likely, hints are few. Be advised that tree climbing and a head for height may be necessary in some cases. \u000a\u000a\u000aTHE POINTS: \u000aThere will be a FTF prize. Qualification for the FTF prize requires the completion of certain conditions. You must find all nine FTF Frustration caches in any order. You must have the highest aggregate point score. Points will be awarded only for the first nine finders of each cache. Scoring will be done according to this chart:\u000aRanking	Points\u000aFTF ..... 9\u000a2nd ..... 8\u000a3rd ..... 7\u000a4th ..... 6\u000a5th ..... 5\u000a6th ..... 4\u000a7th ..... 3\u000a8th ..... 2\u000a9th ..... 1\u000aYou must show proof of your find by uploading a clear photo showing your name in the log sheet, as well as the previous name listed. I will delete any spoilers, photo or written, until the winner is announced. I, and I alone, will decide the final winner, the prize and the time and method of delivering the prize. I will post the aggregate winner on each of the nine FTF Frustration web pages.\u000a\u000aTHIS CACHE:\u000aLittle Cataraqui Conservation Area is located just out of Kingston, less than 2km north of Hwy 401 off Division Street. (aka Perth Road). Facilities include outdoor centre with education and recreation programs, hiking and cross-country ski trails, picnic areas, demonstration maple sugar bush, canoe and kayak rentals in summer, ski and snowshoe rentals in winter. Information and trail maps can be found at http://www.cataraquiregion.on.ca/lands/littlecat.htm . There is a small entrance fee. Rumour has it that locals have been known to utilize a back gate off Bur Brook Road somewhere around coordinates N  44 18.012, W 076 30.267 but I cannot attest to its veracity. The cache is found on the \u201cSugar Bush Loop\u201d trail.  GPS reception may be compromised due to the tree cover at the cache site. Look for the thickest Maple tree next to the #3 trail signpost. It\u2019s one of those.\u000a\u000a** Congratulations on FTF bluenoserstoo **\u000a\u000a                \u000a** ** ** ** ** ** HONOUR ROLL ** ** ** ** ** **\u000a\u000a(All 9 of the FTF Frustration Series completed)\u000a\u000aMay 27 07............bluenoserstoo\u000aNov 14 07..............mTn_biKer65\u000aApr 24 08..................2 paddlers\u000aSep 15 08..................kayakers2\u000aDec 03 08...............KayakGeokid\u000aSep 09 09...............Trail Blaisers\u000aOct 20 09...............AaronHaynes\u000a.

VSometimes the best way to explain geocaching to family is to set one up.  During the holidays I setup this multi-cache in the park around the corner from "home".  It consists of 2 camoflaged micros (one smaller than the other).  Parents are already standing by trying to identify the geocachers who drive by their front door on the way to the cache.\u000a\u000aYou should be able to finish this in less time than most traditional caches.  So if you have ever hesitated about taking on a multi-cache swing on by.  After this you will never dread them again.\u000a\u000aDuring the summer you might have to use stealth as its a great place for kids to hang out playing ball and flying kites.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VBumblebees are social insects.\u000aLike geocachers, they like the outdoors, they hunt and they hide all their good stuff in very specific places. \u000aBees will only sting if you do something to make them angry.\u000aBe careful when you hunt for this cache to not anger the cache guardians, you never know where they are lurking.

VKilroy: "I picked up my 900th find while heading down I-81 and I-95 to Florida, then grabbed my 1000th while in Florida (appropriately, a bison tube in a tree in a seaside park), and then found some more on the return trip without ever getting more than a few hundred feet off the highway."\u000a\u000aHis Better Half: "I had almost the same number of finds on the trip without ever getting more than 100 feet away from the geo-mobile."   \u000a\u000aIt seemed that almost all of these interstate highway caches were lamp skirts and guard rails and tree hangers, with a difficulty rarely above 1 or 1.5.  Thankfully there were also a few larger containers used as travel bug hotels, but that's another story.\u000a\u000aFor those of you who aren't going to be doing any interstate highway caching in the near future, but would like a sampling of the same opportunity to pad their numbers, we've jointly put out this series of caches.  For those who like a real challenge, look elsewhere.\u000a\u000aThere are four caches in this series.  The first three are traditional micros, and you will find the co-ordinates for the final cache inside the first three.\u000a\u000aPlease take time and care to put the log back in the container properly.  That's likely going to be the most difficult part of this cache.\u000a\u000aHMMM!  FTF SUPPOSEDLY SHARED BY GWBBH AND CANADIAN ZOMBIE, BUT CZ CONTINUED FROM HERE TO THE FINAL AND GINA HASN'T BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE.  I'M AWARDING THE FTF HONOUR TO GWBBH (IN MEMORIAM - RIP).

VMy first week back at school was a hectic one. Let me tell you about it.\u000aOn Monday, I started off in Stauffer to get my student card, which took 14.5 minutes, which made me late for my first class, so I ran the whole way down university to McLaughin Hall, arriving 2.44 minutes late for my first class. \u000aLater that day, I finished lunch in the JDUC and was walking to class down Union when I almost got hit by a car but thankfully jumped out of the way in time, and decided to cut down Fifth Field Company Lane (and noted that the street has one peculiar name, and I lost track of time as I tried to figure out the digital root of the street name), and headed into the backdoor of Ontario to see a professor, before grabbing a coke from Kingston Hall on my way to class in Theology Hall.\u000aAfter that class, I grabbed a coffee in Tim Hortons in biosci, but the line was really long and I was 14 cents short, so I spent some time trying to beg for change from other people in line, which again made me late. I ran across the lawn to theology, and then headed down beside the tennis courts where a couple students were playing tennis (score was 15-15 if anyone is curious), and was stopped outside etherington by a friend who had a book to return to me, so I followed him back down Stuart and then to Waldron tower to get the book. As I left Waldron, I slipped down the steps, breaking my arm and I rushed to the KGH ER room, where I spent 3.5 hours waiting before I was able to go home.\u000aOn Tuesday, I returned a library book (26 weeks overdue, don't even want to know what the late charges for that will be) to Stauffer, then cut across the newly finished football field to Bader lane, and then head down university to Stuart and then arrived at the film house with 13.4 minutes to spare before class, and without any real incident - maybe my day was looking up. \u000aAfter class, I left the film house and headed to Mac-Corry, only to find it locked, so I walked back to Bader and took Albert up to watch some Queen's football on the new field.\u000aOn Wednesday, I parked at Goodes Hall, and headed to the JDUC to meet mm_dancer for lunch, and after lunch walked down University, and headed into mac-corry to show mm_dancer room 76, since she had been unable to find it, and then headed back to University to Stuart and from there back to the film house for film 440. \u000aAfter class, I walked back down Stuart to university, and up to mac-corry where I stopped to get some lunch, then walked up University to the JDUC to mail a letter (cost me 1.64$), and then returned to my car at Goodes to find out I had a parking ticket for 230$. \u000aThat night, I had dinner in the JDUC and left, walking down Union to Barrie, and from there to the Grad club to meet some friends for drinks.\u000aThursday, I grabbed a coffee (1.45$ before tip) at the Tea Room in Goodwin Hall, and then grabbed some breakfast (9.85$) in the JDUC, and headed down university, stopping in Kingston Hall to pick up a textbook, and cut out back and headed to theology hall to meet a friend, before walking her back to residence at Ban Righ.\u000aOn Friday, I dropped a friend off at Vic Hall (he's a short guy, only 4'10") and wanted to head to Morris but due to construction, I had to drive down to Albert, onto Stuart, onto St. Lawrence, and then right onto King St. W in order to get to Morris Hall to drop off another friend in room 354.\u000aI woke up Saturday, to the sound of my blackberry going off with a new cache notification. While I was very tempted to sleep in after such a long week, I decided to go for it. Can you figure out where the cache is?\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VThis container should be available all year long.  This is a great spot to come to sit and enjoy the view.  I have even stopped here to read a book.   It is on private property (shared ownership and my dad owns a share) and can be accessed from either end of a trail.  No need to bushwhack.  Attempting to bushwhack would be futile. (unless you want to swim)   Parking is available at 44 17.813 N, 76 27.360 W    if you are doing Erik's Cache too; but, it can be a shorter hike going in from the other end of the trail at 44  18.126 N, 76 27.382 W\u000aPlease respect the property!!! Owners maintain this area for a foot path.  Mountain Bikes are acceptable only when they don't make ruts! \u000a\u000aCongratulations to jwscheepers  on the FTF.....\u000aGlad you enjoyed the spot.

VThe cache is <b>NOT</b> at the posted coordinates. You will need to\u000asolve the puzzle to determine the final cache coordinates. What is\u000athis puzzle? Simply, it is a picture logic puzzle in which cells in\u000aa grid have to be colored or left blank according to the code of\u000anumbers given at the side or bottom of the grid to reveal a hidden\u000apicture. The numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in\u000acells there are in any given row or column. \u000a<p>The numbers on the right of each row represent how many\u000aconsecutive blocks of cells are solid (in this case, black). The\u000acomma (if one) will mean there is a space (not solid) of at least\u000aone cell between the blocks of solid cells. For rows, these numbers\u000aare worked left to right. The numbers at the bottom of each column\u000aare worked from top to bottom.</p>\u000a<p>For example, a clue of "4,1,3" for a row would mean there are\u000asets of four, one, and three filled cells, in that order, moving\u000afrom left to right, with one or more blank cells between the\u000agroups.</p>\u000a<p>I have filled out the bottom third of the puzzle to get you\u000astarted.</p>\u000a<img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~jbullock1/geocache/kache.jpg"\u000aalt="puzzle grid" /> \u000a<h3>This cache cannot be logged until after 6:00am, November 1st\u000a2008 and any logs before then will be deleted.</h3>\u000a<p>You can check your answers for this puzzle on\u000a<a href="http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=7feaf8d0205a668600febf36393bcc77&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433148335458&amp;name=4b41434845202d20426c61636b202620576869746520">\u000aGeochecker.com</a>.</p>\u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

Cache cannot be logged until after 6:00am, November 1st 2008 and any logs before then will be deleted.\u000aThis cache is located in newly developed area of Kingston.  The area is now home to a new fourplex, and soon there will be hotels in the area as well.  The actual site was once a quarry that contained a Fire Training Centre.  We are still waiting for a new one.\u000a\u000aThere will be a small "First To Find" prize.

The day\u000astarted off well, there was a gentle breeze and a cool wind, but\u000athe boat and it's occupants made it to the cache with few problems\u000aother than a little hypothermia (see the logs for <font color=\u000a"#0000FF">Royal Pain</font>). The real problems started on our\u000ajourney back to Amherstview, the wind had picked up significantly\u000aand the waves were topping out at 4 feet. The boat was being\u000abattered and slamming on the waves, then disaster struck and the\u000aengine mount broke, sending the engine plummeting to the bottom,\u000athe result of this was a huge gash in the back of the boat. The\u000aboat began taking on some serious water, Captain Coman started\u000abarking out orders to <em>"BAIL",</em> so Agrell and I started to\u000abail out the water like madmen, but the effort was becoming\u000afruitless as we weren't able to bail fast enough. We saw a small\u000aarea of land about a kilometer away and I suggested that we abandon\u000aship and try to swim there. Now Agrell and I had been in the water\u000aalready and were used to the sting of it's temperature, but Captain\u000aComan wasn't and he immediately fainted, leaving Agrell and myself\u000ato swim the kilometer in high seas and freezing cold water to the\u000aisland, dragging him behind. We made it to the island and\u000aimmediately fell down on the beach totally exhausted. We regain our\u000asenses a short time later, but were shivering from the cold. We\u000alooked around and saw no boats within eyeshot, so we began to think\u000aof ideas to keep us warm. Coman123 had an idea, but&nbsp;Agrell\u000aand&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't want to go there, so I suggested that we put\u000aout a cache here, we all agreed and began looking for materials for\u000athe hide. I had a film cannister and a scrap piece of paper, Agrell\u000aand Coman123 got some rocks and sticks and we were off making a\u000acache. We were so consumed with this task that we almost missed a\u000aboat with the "Budweiser Girls" passing the island heading to an\u000aevent in Kingston. We shouted and screamed (Coman123 ran around\u000anude almost scaring them off)&nbsp;and they stopped and picked us\u000aup, dropping us off at the dock in Amherstview. We sat on the dock\u000awith some dry clothing that the girls had given us and we all\u000alooked at each other, laughed and started to\u000asing.................<br />\u000a<br /></font></strong><strong><font size="5"><font color=\u000a"#000000"><em><font color="#FF0000">Just sit right back and you'll\u000ahear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip, that started from\u000aAhmerstview, aboard this tiny\u000aboat.............<br /></font></em><br /></font></font></strong><font face="Porky's"><font size="5"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#000000">In\u000acase you didn't read the story, the cache is indeed on an island,\u000aout in the middle of nowhere really. There would be access to this\u000aone from Kingston, Anherstview and perhaps Amherst Island. I would\u000asuggest that if going by kayak or canoe that you plan your day\u000acarefully as the waves do get quite high around here and there's\u000anot much help around if you get into trouble. If going by boat, you\u000ahave a few options, but the beach on the island would accomodate a\u000areasonable sized boat being pulled up on shore. If you decide to\u000aswim to this cache, then you're totally hardcore and my hero. The\u000acache is a white film cannister that if you check out the spoiler\u000apic will be a very easy find. So have fun, but&nbsp;don't get\u000astranded on Gilligan's Island.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aCheers<br />\u000aCZ<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<a href=\u000a"http://s666.photobucket.com/albums/vv30/canadianzombies/?action=view&amp;current=DSC00852.jpg"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://i666.photobucket.com/albums/vv30/canadianzombies/DSC00852.jpg"\u000aborder="0" alt="Photobucket" /></a><br />\u000a<br /></font></strong> <strong><font color="#000000"><font size=\u000a"6"><em>Spoiler Pic<br /></em></font><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<a href=\u000a"http://s666.photobucket.com/albums/vv30/canadianzombies/?action=view&amp;current=Sunk.jpg"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src=\u000a"http://i666.photobucket.com/albums/vv30/canadianzombies/Sunk.jpg"\u000aborder="0" alt="Photobucket" /></a><br /></font></strong>\u000a<em><strong><font color="#000000">P.S.

VA new Motel 6 is being built at a location where, from my childhood, deer and an abundance of wildlife  and waterfowl use to be wandering free. When I first saw the lane widening construction of the 401 and the construction of many new commercial sites  here I feared that once again nature would lose and the things I once enjoyed espying would be lost too. But today as I was seeking a trailhead for the K&P geocache series I was very relieved and pleasantly surprised at the GREEN PROJECT all around the Motel 6 property and perimeter. There appears to be some really nice walking paths to the west and the grounds appear to have had some seriously thought out horticultural planning.\u000a\u000aEnjoy this easy to find cache and when you get to GZ you will know the meaning of the title for the cache.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATS to ELSA57 and MM_DANCER on the FTF

VThe cache is NOT at the posted co-ordinates. It's at N44 ab.cde W76\u000afg.hij. In order to find the correct location, you will need to\u000amatch the name of the horse with the name of its owner or claim to\u000afame. This cache is a cammo'd pill bottle, grabbed and re-located\u000afrom Aaronhaynes' "Pay it Forward". BYOP. It should be an easy\u000apuzzle with the help of Google, and an easy find (after you realize\u000athat your maps for this area are out of date).

VHopefully you will at least find the location interesting.  I suspect that few if any Kingston Cachers have been here before.  Stay away from the railway tracks and bring your own pen or pencil.\u000a\u000aThere are now two containers/caches at GZ.  The original had disappeared down a hole and was replaced, but someone later managed to retrieve the first one. You can log in at whichever one you find (no fair trying to claim two finds, though).\u000a\u000aCongrats to CJ and son Ronnoc29 on their first FTF!

VThis 'coin' cache is named after Kash the golden retreiver who loves to walk in the area, and is located near the south end of a long fenced walkway at the end of Rosedale Drive. You can also access the trail from the east through the playground. The cache is a small plastic cigarette container, covered in camouflage tape (squeeze the container to open). Contents at the time of posting include a log book & pencils in a plastic bag, a travel bug and a collection of coins from countries around the world including UK, France, Spain, Mexico, China and Italy. The container has enough space for a few coins, small travel bugs & trading items. Please trade fairly, and carefully hide the cache exactly where it was found. Thank you, and have fun!\u000a\u000a*** Congratulations to the FTF, AaronHaynes !!! ***

VAfter being introduced to geocaching this month and finding the searching aspect rather enjoyable, Princess_Alex has decided to try her hand at actually hiding a cache of her own.  This is one of her favourite parks to go for a walk in.  So if you like a pleasant walk down well maintained trails, you shouldn't have too much difficulty locating this one.

VJust off the trail in Lemoine Point - no bushwacking should be necessary, provided you select the correct trail.  The trail is rather popular and can be very busy at times, so be careful of muggles.  A small, cammo'd tupperware container filled with items selected by the princess, appropriate for other geocaching princesses.  There is room for small trade and trackable items.  No FTF prize, just an ego boost.

VCache is a small Lock n Lock hidden in a green space off Prince Charles Dr. The trailhead is found at N44 14.830 W076 36.447. It is an enjoyable 100m walk along the creek through a grove of maple trees. The path is not easily visible with all the fallen leaves, but this won't cause any difficulties. It should be an easy walk for all but the littlest legs. A great family cache with a unique rock / water feature near the cache. A 2m wide rock shelf crosses the creek. The water disappears on the upstream side, only to reappear below the rocks on the downstream side.

Over and over the voices would not\u000alet up. This cache was inspired by the evil Ztirnats. Ztrinats\u000abrought bluenoserstoo to life. The bushwhacking, the itchy\u000ascratchy, late nights, the scrapes, the falls, the laughs ahh good\u000atimes. Ztirnats being as evil as they are, had to send\u000abluenoserstoo off to Kingston in proper style. They put together a\u000amulti just for them. With prizes along the way. This cache was part\u000aof that multi, bluenoserstoo being newbie cachers could not find\u000athis one. With a little hint from Ztirnats they were able to find\u000ait. Oh the feeling of excitement when they picked up the cache the\u000alook of pure evilness that came from there eyes. So evil. The\u000avoices of Ztirnats kept them awake at nights tossing and turning\u000abuild the cache and they will come. It\u2019s now up to you to find the\u000acache stop the voices of those pesting Ztirnats so bluenoserstoo\u000acan sleep at night. Find the cache, log the cache, curse at the\u000acache, smile at the cache, whatever you need to do to help stop the\u000avoices. Good Luck and have fun. Remember our caches are about the\u000ahunt.</p>\u000a<p>Sorry we can't give you much information on the cache as it\u000awould give it away, you will understand when you find it. Any\u000aspolier pictures or hints in the logs will be deleted. Please put\u000aback exactly as found and camo it the same if not better then you\u000afound it.

VI have on more than one occasion found a puzzle cache merely by the\u000ascant visual clues provided in a previous finder&rsquo;s posted\u000aphoto. This requires a certain amount of patience, persistence,\u000aobservation skill, common sense, and a love for the hunt; aptitudes\u000athat, as geocachers, we all possess to some degree. It&rsquo;s all\u000aa matter of perspective. To find this cache will require all the\u000aabove and some time in the field. Two photos are provided and more\u000athan enough information to find the cache. Despite the D3 rating,\u000asome may find the solution easier, some harder. The cache is not\u000aat, but is within 3km of, the posted coordinates. No FTF prize,\u000ajust bragging rights. Please do not provide additional clues in\u000ayour logs or with your photos.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center><img src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/4678111c-ff18-47dd-9ea2-6498c8f31b19.jpg"\u000aalt="&gt;" /></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center><img src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/5e057c61-7df3-4c90-8c43-859cce12c496.jpg"\u000aalt="&gt;" /></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<center><img src=\u000a"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/621e8552-5622-4205-a300-7d9019dc01ff.jpg"\u000aalt="&gt;" /></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center><font color="orange">Congrats Team Jevre on the FTF\u000a!</font></center><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VThis is the memory of a place from my childhood where my parents would bring my brothers and I to take a walk. In the Spring this was a torrent of rushing water and it was an exciting adventure to have my Dad take me by the hand up and through the rocks and water from the bottom (where this cache is placed) to the top (where you will not venture today) We would explore all along the waterfall and wander about the woodland, often stopping to have a family picnic amidst the bloom of some magnificent Ontario wildflowers. It was a spectacular place to come and for many years when we were growing up this became a regular Spring outing.\u000a\u000aToday it is with sadness that as I return to visit this once playful adventuresome spot that  the entire perimeter is now littered with NO TRESPASSING SIGNS. A visit to the falls is now forbidden as is the walk in the woods all along the roadway.\u000a\u000aThe entire area from the top of the waterfall to the northwest corner where the lilacs use to bloom by the hundreds has been transformed. No longer is it a welcoming spot for people to view nature but it has become FORBIDDEN to walk the falls. The lilacs that once bloomed row upon row have been cut down and replaced by a heated driveway.\u000a\u000aFortunately, the access to the cache is on a public road and is a FAST grab and go.You could almost reach the cache without getting out of your car. But please take the time to look for the falls in its season. \u000a\u000aIn the Spring this is a wonderful sight and at the moment of placing this cache the water was flowing and babbling a WELCOME to those who will come to pay tribute to this lovely spot.\u000a\u000aPlease respect the owner's NO TRESPASS signs(there are many littered all over the area!) but your camera can go where people cannot so I highly recommend bringing your camera for a glimpse of the FORBIDDEN FALLS OF GIBSON'S HILL. \u000a\u000aIt is highly encouraged to come to this cache DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS so you can afford a view and also be safe during inclement weather periods. Some of the area near the cache can be unstable due to erosion or ice in the winter months. If you do wish to go over a snowbank in the winter caused by the snowplows, EXERCISE CAUTION as the water can continue to run before the winter freeze-up.\u000a\u000aFor interested birders, there are many nest boxes to the Creek area south of this cache and in the Spring it hosts many guinea hens, herons, wood ducks and the occasional harriers.With the waters roiling the wetlands often remain open during the winter and can afford you the rare glimpse of the occasional beaver. \u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO\u000aMTN_BIKERS65, ELSA57 and MM_DANCER  THE TRIPLE FUN OF THE FTF

Va wee bit of a difference in this cache. Try your french translation skills or use the internet. \u000a\u000aVisitez l'Île de Wolfe et appréciez un autre geocache sympathique à gamin. Le choix de langue vient de ma nièce qui faisait les études pour sa classe française. Juste une façon de concevoir une cache bilingue à l'Île de Wolfe. \u000aVous cherchez un petit récipient qui a un élément de GENTILLESSE DE GAMIN.\u000aApportez votre propre stylo et ne cachez pas s'il vous plaît après le crépuscule ou dans l'obscurité.\u000aRespectez la communauté, la cache et les enfants qui l'ont placé.\u000a\u000a*** Les félicitations mes amis d'île sur votre découverte de la bête C'est magnifique!***

VTrails are hallmarks of livable communities and of cities that are built on a human scale. Despite its scenic location, Kingston has very few dedicated off-road trails, and those it does have are short and do not connect with other trail systems. However, there are 14 kilometers of unused railbed in the rural areas of Kingston and another 7 km within the old city limits of Kingston, parts of which are now being transformed into a viable multi-use pathway capable of supporting cycling, hiking, cross-country skiing and equestrian activities.\u000a\u000aNick-named by locals as the "Kick and Push", the K&P Railroad has been abandoned for years, but offers the opportunity to provide a trail running from Kingston to Harrowsmith and potentially as far north as Sharbot Lake. At Harrowsmith, the trail could connect with the existing Cataraqui Trail, a part of the Trans-Canada Trail network. The K&P right-of-way (ROW) is partly owned by Bell Canada, but the ROW within the rural area of Kingston has now been acquired by the city, and South Frontenac Township has expressed interest in acquiring the ROW within the township limits. \u000a \u000aToday, while out with your GPS looking for the easy micro, please enjoy the LEASHED walk with your pup. Important note: Please read the signs posted at the entry way to the trails which indicates consequences for loose dogs in this rural "rails to trails" area.\u000a\u000aCongrats to The Queen of FTF and Elsa57 .Good to see you were able to get out and about for some. Enjoy the easy numbers.

This cache can be hard to get to and will take some climbing over rock on a cliff edge but can be done if you take your time going over. Parking for this cache can be found at N 44 14.335 W 76 37.301. This cache will be more of a challenge in early spring because some of the rocks are covered by the high water level.

VThe cache requires a couple kilometre hike, and has two options for parking areas. One area is in the Bayshore Estates neighbourhood of Kingston (N44,14.328, W076,37.312) and is probably the most scenic walk in. The other option is to park on Taylor Kidd Blvd. just off Collins Bay Road and walk south. Taylor Kidd is a busy road though, so be careful if you park here.\u000aThe trails are fairly good, although there are some ruts from ATV's driving through. The trails can be busy depending when you go, so watch for mugglers.\u000aCache contains pen and notepad, but it doesn't hurt to bring your own pen or pencil just in case!\u000aPlease place cache back exactly as found!\u000aNo first to find prize, just the boost to your ego.\u000a\u000aCongrats mTn_biker65 on FTF!

So maybe this is not a trailhead, despite the\u000aadvertising. <br />\u000aShould be an easy find for bicyclists and late night cachers. For\u000athe rest of us, parking is going to be a problem for this cache.\u000aLimited parking is possible on the south side of this street, but\u000abe careul and avoid trying this one in rush hour and other busy\u000atimes. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aCongrats to the Hovencamps and to CJ+ArmyBrats on a shared\u000aFTF.

VThis is the first cache set by team Kali-roo!  It's along one of our favourite hiking/mountain biking trails in Kingston... definitely the pup's favourite.  Dog friendly, bike friendly.  The terrain is hilly with lots of logs, limestone, and single-track.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a 3-stage multi... the first is a micro but the rest are regular caches (#2 is a small protein powder container, #3 a large one).  All of the containers are covered in handy CAMOUFLAGE duct tape.  \u000a\u000aThe limestone you'll be walking over is Ordovician (very roughly ~450 Ma) and the exposed surface is rich in fossils such as cephalapods, gastropods (snails... in particular Maclurites here), and various bivalves and trace fossils.  These are basically the rocks you see all over Kingston.\u000a\u000aGood luck and post your favourite cephalapod shot!\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000aTHWTEE - Trailhead\u000aN 44° 14.892 W 076° 37.440\u000a\u000a

VYou are looking for a container that initially might cause some of the weak in heart to leap back but "feel" free to discover the FUN in this cache. \u000a\u000aThere is a section of this container that any "KID" of geocaching will enjoy. Slip with this cache and play the Micheal Jackson moonwalk with this item if you like. Play with the little thing for the fun or take a snap of the kids enjoying the find. Photos with your "hand" inside the cache will be accepted but are not a requirement for a smiley...the cache is meant to be FUN. \u000a\u000aWell...it will be fun for those who discover what this last sentence means!\u000a\u000aYou will be travelling on Wolfe Island off Oak Point Road towards Chubb Shoal. There is parking along the side of the road and all cachers should be without notice if it is done with stealth and respect for the neighbours. SHRIEKS might happen at this cache so be prepared to NOT CACHE AT NIGHT. I REPEAT...ABSOLUTELY NO CACHING AFTER SUNSET. This is a daytime cache as there is an area of little car traffic and after dusk the lights of cars will arouse suspicions to the folks who live on this road. PLEASE respect the community here as this island is a great place to visit and cache.\u000aPlease respect any signage of PRIVATE LANES. There is no need to drive down any private road and the cache is NOT on private land. It is just off the side of the road in a dead fall zone.\u000aCache is within a short stepping off point from the side of the road.In the winter there may be a snowdrift to leap but nothing that a winter cacher cannot do.\u000aPlease replace the cache in a friendly, gentle way for the next cacher and try to have it nested in such a way that it can "coccoon" for a winter season.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATS JEVRE ON THE FTF.\u000aGREAT PICS FOR THE CACHING KID IN ALL OF US!

VThis was the last visit of our day as the Caching Kids and I ventured to the final cache hide on the LONG ISLAND of Ganounkouesnot. The children helped make the outside decorations for the hide so please be careful with your retrieval. Feel free to post any snaps of yourself with the "Kritters" for the fun but please note that it is NOT a requirement for the smiley. The kids just want folks to enjoy the place, have some fun and enjoy their container.\u000aThe old homestead that is there was a wee bit creepy and they wanted to leave something more touchy feely but we left that at the other side of the island. Be sure to try and pick up that one off Oak Point Road.\u000aAs we near the two year mark of the caching pastime, we wish you all happy holidays over the December days and many HAPPY TRAILS.\u000aCheers from SKYE53, SKYELADDIE and the CACHINGKIDS.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS from the KRITTERS to Aaronhaynes and the kids.

VThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road.\u000a\u000aIt is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aIn celebration of my 2000+ it is time to give back to the caching community with this walking or cycling tour of simple to find geocaches. I will be publishing traditional geocaches all along the K&P Trail in the next week. All caches are MEANT TO BE FOUND and have no need for racing for FTF as there are no prizes. The geocaches are intended for recreational enjoyment. FUN is the operative word.\u000a\u000aPlease bring along your own writing utensil and please replace the cache in excellent condition for the next person to find. \u000a\u000aFor any of my caches where swag is found, please remember to trade up or trade even with gently used items or new swag appropriate for all ages. Please no distasteful trinkets. TB and GCs are more than welcome to pass along.\u000a\u000aI would highly recommend this set of geocaches for the newbie to geocaching. There are a variety of traditional style hides that would be a good starting point to their FUN.\u000a\u000aPlease note that the day I placed the hides it was pouring rain and the coordinates will not be perfect. Please feel free if you find them off, to publish in your log the improved GZ to help others who follow.\u000a\u000aEnjoy the hunt and try to keep the deerflies away...cycling fast will help.  LOL LOL\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO PROCELL AND WOVENCAMP FOR THE SHARED FTF. Hope you enjoyed the walk!

V<p>There are 4 stages, the 1st and 2nd are micros, the 3rd is\u000asmall, the 4th slightly larger.</p>\u000a<p>DON'T DO THIS ONE if you\u2019re in a hurry or lack patience. It\u2019s in\u000aa great network of trails but it will take quite a few minutes to\u000awalk to the 1st cache sight and then again to find the other\u000acaches. I tried to hide these caches so as to hopefully make the\u000aexperience a bit interesting. Hopefully the walk will be enjoyable\u000aas well. Bring Rover along because these somewhat hilly trails are\u000avery dog friendly and bike friendly. The caches are located on the\u000anorth side of Taylor-Kidd Dr. just west of Collins Bay Rd. Most\u000apeople pull off the road at about 44 14. 999, 076 36.970 but there\u000ais also an entrance a bit further west at about 44 14.916, 076\u000a37.748.</p>\u000a<p>The coordinates for these waypoints tend to jump around a bit. I\u000atook several readings on different days and averaged them out as\u000abest I could. There may be a few muggles at the last cache so\u000aplease be careful not to give it away. There is no need to do much\u000abushwhacking since you\u2019ll only be a 'few' metres off the main trail\u000afor all but one wpt. There may be poison oak in some parts and of\u000acourse summer in the woods means mosquitoes. A flashlight may come\u000ain handy. Tread CAREFULLY or you may destroy evidence. Please put\u000athe cache back \u2018exactly\u2019 as you found it so that others can have\u000athe same experience. Please resist posting spoilers or other\u000aindicators.

It's time\u000ato wake him. While on your quest take time to enjoy the scenery.\u000aListen to the silence. Tread quietly and you will find that deer\u000amay come out to investigate. Birds will certainly feed from your\u000ahand. Please note that you will NEVER need to pick apart the\u000aterrain. To do so would be useless to your search and destructive\u000ato the environment. Use you eyes and your head instead of your\u000ahands. NOTHING need be uncovered, only discovered. Although snow\u000amay need to be brushed away at one spot. PLEASE, no geo-mobs for\u000athis one. Mob finds tend to destroy the site and show disrespect\u000afor the cache. And we wouldn\u2019t want to disrespect Bluenosers. In\u000athe true spirit of geocaching, enjoy the satisfaction of making\u000ayour own find. Post no spoilers. Email me directly if you have\u000aconcerns with this cache and I will address them, however I will\u000anot provide extra hints, explanation or confirmation of\u000acalculations until after the FTF.</p>\u000a<p>Tools:</p>\u000a<p>To alleviate frustration and boredom along the way you may find\u000athe following items useful at one point or another. Sketchpad, pen,\u000acalculator, compass, GPSr, birdwatcher\u2019s binoculars, birdseed\u000a(Chickadees love sunflower seeds), flashlight, pocket mirror,\u000acamera, water, snack. In your wisdom you might choose to forgo one\u000aor more of these items. Perhaps you may live not to regret your\u000adecision.</p>\u000a<p>Tasks:</p>\u000a<p>First (This can be done at home).<br />\u000aDisregard the posted coordinates, they are meaningless. In order to\u000afind the first waypoint for your bluequest you may want to consider\u000aa couple of simple caches. They will lead you to a patterned sign\u000aof the same colours. I have full confidence in KAG's ability to put\u000atwo and two together using the information available to quickly\u000across this task off their lists.</p>\u000a<p>Second (This is done on site. Sorry, but it's the only tedious\u000apart.)<br />\u000aAt this patterned sign your next task will be to determine the\u000are-direct by the following process. Count the total of light and\u000adark sections of this sign to get the answer X. Now look around.\u000aYou will see many numbers within a few metres. You will need two of\u000athese in particular; you\u2019ll know which ones when you find them.</p>\u000a<p>Add the answer X to the larger of these \u2018newly-found\u2019 numbers,\u000athen divide the result by the smaller of the \u2018newly-found\u2019 numbers\u000ato get an answer with many decimal places. Move the decimal two\u000aplaces to the right to obtain a three-digit number and disregard\u000athe rest of the decimal places. This is your bearing in degrees\u000amagnetic. (My GPS used magnetic declination of 13 degrees W.)</p>\u000a<p>Now, working with the \u2018newly-found\u2019 numbers again, divide the\u000asmaller of the two numbers by one-thousandth of its own value. This\u000ais your distance in metres. Do your projection from the original\u000apatterned sign.</p>\u000a<p>Your projection may be slightly off, but your destination should\u000abe a small open glen just east of two very tall evergreens. Here\u000ayou will need to use your eyes for clues. Search high and low.\u000aThere is a small FTF prize.</p>\u000a<p>When you find the cache...PLEASE...retrieve it gently.</p>\u000a<center>*** CONGRATULATIONS *** TOP DOZEN ***</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a \u000a<center>FTF.....Guardian14.....December 10, 2007</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>2TF.....Bluelamb03.....December 27, 2007</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>3TF.....Remote Sensor.....December 27, 2007</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>4TF.....Swimmrguy.....December 29, 2007</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>5TF.....Bluenoserstoo.....December 29, 2007</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>6TF.....Skottikus.....January 05, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>7TF.....mTn_biKer65.....February 04, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>8TF.....Bluesaway.....April 09, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>9TF.....Ace862.....April 09, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>10TF.....Bullockj.....May 24, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>11TF.....Mr&amp;MrsSmooshy.....May 24, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<center>12TF.....Umilik.....May 26, 2008</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br /><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

V<p align="center"><strong>There is a long time folk tale that has\u000abeen told generation after generation of an unmarked Native Burial\u000aGround on the outskirts of Kingston.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs the story goes it is said that if you bury a small creature in\u000athis cemetery on the eve of a full moon, the spirits will deliver\u000athe soul of the creature back to its body and resurrect<br />\u000a<br />\u000ait to the form it once was.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aI decided I had to see if I could find this place and talk to some\u000aof the locals, to see if they had heard of this place.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aI stopped into a friend of mines house He had indeed heard the folk\u000atale of the "Undead Cemetery" but he would not take me there.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aHe had been warned by his Grandmother ,to never go there, it's\u000adangerous, an un-holy place.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aWell no luck there, so I went into town and there was an old woman\u000asitting on the steps of this run down shanty.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs I was passing her she whispered out to me in a raspy old\u000avoice.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aI know the place where you seek to go, I can tell you how to get\u000athere.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aSo I sit down and I'm about to ask her a question, she goes into a\u000achant.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aLong, long time ago, those who passed away, with out finishing\u000athere earth journey would be buried in the Cemetery of the Undead,\u000atheir souls would<br />\u000a<br />\u000aleave their bodies, but on the first full moon, they would rise\u000afrom the dead, to finish what ever they had started in their\u000aprevious lives.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aBut be warned, placing those whom do not belong in the Cemetery of\u000athe Undead, is very dangerous , I know what you want to do<br />\u000a<br />\u000aMake sure you are ready for what ever evil happens ,until your\u000afriends journey is done.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aHe will have no friends, he can not be stopped, HE WILL GET REVENGE\u000a!!!!!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aShe then handed me a rolled up piece of paper, "A Map" I turned\u000aback to her to ask "Where do I start", You must start where your\u000afriend once lived she said.

VThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road.\u000a\u000aIt is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aIn celebration of my 2000+ it is time to give back to the caching community with this walking or cycling tour of simple to find geocaches. I will be publishing traditional geocaches all along the K&P Trail in the next week. All caches are MEANT TO BE FOUND and have no need for racing. The geocaches are intended for recreational enjoyment. FUN is the operative word.\u000a\u000aThere are no FTF prizes. Please bring along your own writing utensil and please replace the cache in excellent condition for the next person to find. For the caches where swag is found, please remember to trade up or trade even with good swag. \u000a\u000aEnjoy your travels along this wonderfully maintained trail.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS WHOVENCAMP ON THE FTF (did you notice I am getting better at spelling your name...guess it takes about 5FTFs before I get it right...LOL LOL )

VThis cache is placed with the purpose of taking you on a lovely drive through the wonders of Wolfe Island. You will venture along the South Shore road with views of Bayfield Island and if conditions are right you will hear the faint whisper of the turbines overshadowed by the loud gaggling of Canada Geese.There are hundreds of birds that shelter on this side of the island and in the winter you will be entertained by the stark beauty of winter and the sculptures of the snow on the shore.\u000aPlease bring your own writing tool and I always recommend bringing a piece of paper in case you have trouble with the logs of any cache. The container is small so please do not place anything other than coins or very small trackables.\u000aThe cache needs to be covered well with camo so please replace as found and offer the next cacher the same experience of a good hide in the gnarly dude.

VThis park is fairly new and was built over a water treatment plant. There is a beautiful view of Lemoines Point and the sailboats travelling from the Collins Bay Marina on Lake Ontario.  You may be lucky enough to watch one of the planes go overhead on its way to the airport.  There are a couple of benches and a picnic table for those who would like a break from caching or just want to enjoy the great view.

The day I found out about\u000acaching I began reading and reading and reading, and came across\u000athe name mTn_biKer65, thinking that it sounded like someone I knew,\u000aI sent an email. Within 20mins I had a phone call, and later that\u000aweek went over for my first geocaching lesson.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a <font color="green" size="4">From then I was hooked, and before\u000aelsa57 and TamiMaRo began caching, he would take me along, even\u000agoing to the extent of re-doing caches he had already found just\u000afor me. It is always nice to cache with a friend, sharing the\u000afrustrations of DNFs, the joy of finds and just plain company on\u000athe trails. Still today we have a blast finding caches, especially\u000aracing for late night FTFs (or any FTF for that matter :) ) This\u000acache has been placed in honour of mTn_biKer65, as he nears his\u000a1000th cache find.<br />\u000a<br /></font> <font color="#FBB117" size="4">This cache is a four\u000astage multi-cache, located just west of Kingston in the small town\u000aof Amherstview. You will be required to drive to certain stages, as\u000athey are not all located in the same area. You will also need to\u000abring a few pennies with you to complete this cache (for stage 3 :)\u000a). Please be sure to replace each stage exactly as found, and take\u000acare with the redirects, as some will be more difficult to replace.\u000aPlease do NOT post any sort of spoiler in your log or photo, allow\u000aeach cacher to enjoy the experience of this cache for\u000athemselves.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aChecksum for first stage: N=20 W=36</font></font> \u000a<center><font color="orange"\u000asize="4"><img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ba1513c1-af1a-4d27-b227-c6c82325474c.jpg" />\u000a</font></center><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road.\u000a\u000aIt is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aIn celebration of my 2000+ it is time to give back to the caching community with this walking or cycling tour of simple-to-find geocaches. It is my hope that FAMILY GEOCACHERS will be able to log a FTF and have that unique pleasure of seeing an open page waiting for them.\u000a\u000aI would also encourage people to use my K&P geocaches as a simple fun day walk and introduce people to the fun that can be found geocaching this wonderful trail system.\u000a\u000a\u000aWoo Hoo WOVENCAMP!  Congratulations on the FTF.\u000aDelighted to see FAMILY GET TOGETHERS OVER GEOCACHES. Woo Hoo !

VThis Island Cache has been placed in close proximity to a fairly decent shingle beach that would be a great place to spend the afternoon. The Cache location offers views of Collins Bay and Amherstview and Lemoine point. There is a good spot to anchor close to shore, then either swim or row in. Load up the boat, anchor, make you way to the cache, and most of all....ENJOY.

VAnyone who enjoys birding knows that Amherst island is a real trophy for viewing the sights of birds off their normal migratory flights and a regular abundance of birds who nest and enjoy this relatively undisturbed area. \u000a\u000aOn this island the favourite of all and the real charmer to many birders and day tourists is the LADY OF THE FOREST... the SAWHET.\u000a\u000aThe cache is easily visible to a geocacher and please feel free to rehide, or add some protective camo to the cache. It is a tennis sleeve with only room for some small items for trades. When I placed the hide there was a lot of snow and with the rains I am sure it will be more visible at this time.\u000a\u000aWe kayak along the shore where this hide is found and I encourage anyone who has a kayak to paddle for this cache on a nice summer day. There is an easy launch from Fairfield park on the mainland and the paddle is an intermediate level one.Please use a kayak with a sprayskirt for any paddling on these open waters. Conditions can easily change from calm to high winds in a matter of hours.\u000a\u000a\u000a*** CONGRATULATIONS TO LUNAFLAME ON THE FTF ***

Amenities are few but not missed.\u000aRoads are predominantly hard-packed gravel and very ride-able.\u000aTraffic is so scant that the family can safely span the roadway.\u000aTake in the lazy drone of insects, the scent of wildflowers, the\u000atastes of summer, the fresh breeze off the lake, the panoramic\u000avistas. Spend an hour or two rejuvenating the soul. Early morning\u000aor evening is recommended but any time in daylight is great.

VThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road.\u000a\u000aIt is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aIn celebration of my 2000+ it is time to give back to the caching community with this walking or cycling tour of simple to find geocaches. I will be publishing traditional geocaches all along the K&P Trail in the next week. All caches are MEANT TO BE FOUND and have no need for racing. The geocaches are intended for recreational enjoyment. FUN is the operative word.\u000a\u000aThere are no FTF prizes. Please bring along your own writing utensil and please replace the cache in excellent condition for the next person to find. \u000aEnjoy your travels along this wonderfully maintained trail.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO PROCELL and WOVENCAMP for their "Shared" FTF.

All caches are\u000aeasily found, camo-taped 3" waterproof match holders hidden within\u000acomfortable reach.</p>\u000a<p>Stella is a small village. Amenities are few but not missed.\u000aRoads are predominantly hard-packed gravel and very ride-able.\u000aTraffic is so scant that the family can safely span the roadway.\u000aTake in the lazy drone of insects, the scent of wildflowers, the\u000atastes of summer, the fresh breeze off the lake, the panoramic\u000avistas. Spend an hour or two rejuvenating the soul. Early morning\u000aor evening is recommended but any time in daylight is great. Take\u000ayour time and enjoy a veritable feast for all the senses.</p>\u000a<center>* Congratulations mTn_biKer65 on the FTF! *</center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />

VOnce upon a time there were 9 lovely little planets (yes we will pretend Pluto is still a planet), orbiting around the sun.  Then all of a sudden there was a huge explosion that sends all the planets spinning out of orbit!  The team of astronauts have a general idea of the whereabouts of 8 of the planets, but are unable to locate Jupiter, the largest planet!\u000a\u000aThe astronauts need your help to recover Jupiter.  Your mission, do you choose to accept it, is to locate and discover each of the eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto).  Each of these planets contains a vital clue to rediscovering the lost Jupiter.\u000a\u000aYour mission will take you on a back roads tour of the outskirts of Kingston, all of the planets are easy to locate, please be discrete and do not draw attention to yourself, or an evil space alien may capture one of the needed planets.  The planets may be discovered in any order, but you will need all eight to locate Jupiter.\u000a\u000aYour mission begins now, your spaceship awaits outside!\u000a\u000a(Jupiter is not at the posted coordinates, you must complete the above mission to find Jupiter.  The puzzle is in the form:\u000aN 44 13._ _ _ W 076 _ _._ _ 4, the missing pieces can be found on each of the other planets, good luck!)\u000a\u000aCongrats to mTn_biKer65, and trusty co-pilot space dog Riley, on successfully completing the entire mission in record time!\u000a\u000aFTF: mTn_biker65\u000a2TF: skottikus\u000a3TF: hypocorism\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VMany months ago I was travelling this road enroute to a geocache when I spied this sign. I had placed a geocache entitled WELCOME TO KINGSTON on the west side of the city and thought at the time this would be a good spot to place a micro. I hid the container and when I got home realized I had not waypointed it. So today while doing a maintenance run of the geocaches I was shocked to find the container laying on the ground and very much intact and dry. So-o-o-o why not do it right and add a number for some folks in this part of Kingston. So here it is.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS COMAN123 on the FTF. Good thing you did not stop for ice cream, eh?

VThis is a picture puzzle cache the kids and I created, that can be found by using pictures as your guide into a very nice and quite area just west of Coronation Blvd., where the Bayview Wetland creek goes under Taylor Kidd. A picture puzzle was the idea my six year old came up with, to help in finding a cache location. Kids can look at pictures on the trip into the cache making the journey as much fun as the prize.\u000a\u000aA beautiful View is on the west side of the stream, and to find our cache you must start on the east. We have set up a few small Inuksuk's (stone markers) along the old logging road to help lead you to our cache location. There is also a light ATV trail which has not had much use to follow along as well.\u000a\u000aTo get started, find this deer stand which is about 100ft in the woods along the east side of the Bayview stream. From here we have taken pictures of Taylor Kidd and it is a good starting marker to find in the trees.\u000a\u000aHere are the pictures which will show you to our cache;\u000a\u000aEntrance Point Taylor Kidd picture\u000aDeer Stand picture\u000aView from the deer stand\u000aDeer stand 2nd picture\u000a\u000aOnce you are at the deer stand, follow the trail up the hill and you will find the trail goes left, right and straight ahead. We have left a stone marker here and have placed a second on the trail to the right which will lead you to a beaver pond.\u000a\u000aLeft right or center trail picture\u000aLeave it to Beaver pond trail picture\u000aTrail to Beaver pond picture\u000a\u000aYou will then come to a little clearing and if you look around you will see a white birch tree where the cache is located. The cache is a white 2.5 gallon bucket with a blue lid which contains some toys and a log book, Please bring some exchange items, a snack, and camera as two white tail deer and a big Tom turkey call this place home. \u000a\u000aGetting Closer picture\u000aLook to your left picture\u000aBirch tree cache picture\u000aHere it is picture\u000a\u000aIf you need to grab your golf clubs to play the back 9 at the Amherstview Golf course than you have gone too far.

VAnother micro along the K&P Trail..\u000a\u000aDeerflies and mosquitoes may be around so if you are walking be sure to take this into consideration.\u000aIf you are cycling, the deerflies/horseflies still get you so even pedalling might not help. Suggest a cool time or a windy cool day...had lots of them this summer@\u000a\u000aThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road. The geocaches I placed take in about a 4km route of the K&P trail where I felt I would have ease in publishing the new traditionals.\u000a\u000aThe trail is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aPlease bring a writing utensil to sign the log and realize that there are no FTF's. With the number of caches I will be publishing the numbers for the accounts is a great PRIZE...\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS TO MACKENZIE OF COMAN123 ON THE FTF. You really can speed on that pink bike. You go, girl!

VThis should be the opposite of a cache and dash, unless your a very\u000alucky person. The redirect should be a quick find, but getting the\u000aco-ordinates will take a little more effort. I but this close to a\u000aplace to park and would suggest taking the redirect to your car to\u000asolve. Take your time as if you rush this you might overlook the\u000aco-ordinates. More instructions at the redirect. I hope you get a\u000afew laughs while doing this. \u000a<center><a href="http://kingstongeocaching.com"\u000atarget="_blank"><img src="http://home.cogeco.ca/~rconnell/images/KAG_small.gif"\u000a     border="0" width="163" height="163" /></a></center>\u000a*****Congrats to team jevre, TamiMaRo, and elsa57 on your\u000aFTF!*****<p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VAll along the Highway 401 I have spotted these wonderful garden-like displays that denote the name of the city you are driving to or passing through. Some of the displays are quite beautiful in summer but this sign is a really unique one, especially at night. For this reason the cache is fun to find at night and because it is a very safe, friendly flat terrain, it would be a nice view of the sign and the cache! Look for the eerie patterns that the lighting projects and what that canopy creates. Something right out of a DICKEN'S tale.\u000a\u000aPlease note that the cache is NOT accessible from the 401 and it is against the law to park at the side of the road at any time on this highway.and no ands, ifs or buts! You cannot claim geocaching  as an emergency stop..so please abide by the law.\u000a\u000aAnother challenge, perhaps for some, to finding this cache is whether or not you can access the correct road and then find the parking spot to make the grab.\u000a\u000aThere is no need to cross over any fences nor to climb any items to reach the cache.\u000a\u000aPlease bring your own pen or pencil to sign the log. \u000a\u000aWhen you are finished this FAST grab you can go over and try the fun cache entitled YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING! Mine is guaranteed to NOT take you much time at all.\u000a\u000aThis cache is winter friendly and if children have adult supervision, they will make fast work on this one. Happy trails!

VWhile taking a tour of the wind turbines I decided to take a long drive along the island to discover many places with views to the lake, vistas of working farmland and a host of other natural scenes. The strands of bittersweet coloured the harvest landscape and I thought this area would be a nice spot to drop a cache.\u000aThis cache is not winter friendly and I would appreciate it that if the container appears to be difficult to retrieve do not stab at it to remove but leave for another visit. This cache is not wnter friendly as it is on the ground and will definitely be frozen or snowed in at this spot.\u000aTo the west you will see the farms of Pyke and thus the name for the cache.There is a small gate to the entry of the field.The cache is NOT on the gate NOR is it at the corner. It is along the fenceline and on the ground.\u000aBring your own pen and as always bring your own extra paper in case some misfortune befalls any hide during the November rains and the approach of winter weather.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS BANDIT...er meant to say...JEVRE! ! !

This is an urban\u000awilderness cache so bring your bug repellant, approach it quietly\u000aand watch for foxes and rabbits. Basic trails are marked with\u000aorange reflective tape in places with very little true\u000abush-whacking required. If you are bashing through the brambles,\u000ayou are definitely taking the hard way! Not a very busy area but\u000awatch for traffic if crossing the road.

V1793 is the date that this lovely old house was built.  The Fairfield family settled here as Loyalists and prospered.  The friends of Fairfield House have worked hard to keep this house intact and to restore it to the original looks.  It was habited until the middle of the 20th century, and is officially owned now by Loyalist Township.  Inside. there is a small museum of artifacts that would have been used by the family during its early years.  The little flower beds have the types of plants that would have been planted at that time.  The stone in the front yard is the limestone base into which the house has been built.  The road in front is part of the original road that went from Kingston to York.  The house is open for tours (please give a donation) during the summer months from Tuesday to Sunday (?).   For more information and pictures of Fairfield House please see the website of the Upper Canada Historical Association www.tradefaire.ca, and follow the links through General Info to Fairfield House slide show. \u000a\u000aWe hope that you enjoy this gem of history.\u000a\u000aThe cache is hidden in an open area so you must be really stealthy when you find it.  Please hid it again carefully.

VThis is a road that I regularly take home. My sons keep arguing that no one ever uses this part of the road. Most folks turn down Coronation BLVD and cross the tracks. I usually keep going and turn down county road 6. \u000a\u000aSo, every time we go my way my oldest son tries to convince me we are the only ones on the road. On average we count 10 cars on what he claims to be an unused part of the road.

VJust like the original...Once you arrive at the posted coordinates, there is not just one but FOUR cache containers. They are NOT all at the posted coordinates. They are within 15 meters of the posted coordinates. They each have their own logbook. Each logbook has a number (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) depending on the size of the cache. The biggest cache has the 1, and the smallest has the 4. They are all different sizes.\u000a\u000aTo claim a find, all you have to do is find ANY of the four containers, and sign the log AND you must put the number of the container you found in your log online.\u000a\u000aHere is where we find out just how addicted you are:\u000a1) Will you settle with the 4? Or will you need to find the 1?\u000a2) Will you settle with finding just one container, or will you need to find all 4?\u000a3) How long will you spend looking? Especially during the event?\u000a\u000aAlso, there is four possible FTFs for this cache!!\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VThe K&P Trail is a 15 km multi-use, semi-urban and rural trail extending from the Little Cataraqui Creek to Orser Road.\u000a\u000aIt is ideal for a variety of recreational uses including walking, hiking, cycling, horse-back riding, and cross-country skiing and provides for a range of scenic experiences with its open landscape, rock cuts and wetlands.\u000a\u000aIn celebration of my 2000+ it is time to give back to the caching community with this walking or cycling tour of simple to find geocaches. I will be publishing traditional geocaches all along the K&P Trail in the next week. All caches are MEANT TO BE FOUND and have no need for racing. The geocaches are intended for recreational enjoyment. FUN is the operative word.\u000a\u000aThere are no FTF prizes. Please bring along your own writing utensil and please replace the cache in excellent condition for the next person to find. \u000a\u000aI should add that along the trails in the summer expect the usual insects, and plants that may cause rashes, such as poison ivy and oak. Dress appropriately and always be on the alert for horseback riders who frequent the trails.\u000a\u000aAlways attend to children and keep them on the trail and in full sight of you at all times.\u000a\u000aThere is not FTF prize and please remember to bring a writing utensil to log your find.\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS to Wovencamp and Procell for yet another shared, friendly first to find.

VThis is a short drive outside the city limits of Kingston on a very well maintained road. It is accessible all year round and the cache, if maintained and replaced as found should be available ALL YEAR ROUND. \u000a\u000aI really liked the area here for the rock patterns and also the find examples of cedar driftwood samples left in the many shelves of the limestone and shale on this route.\u000a\u000aPlease be mindful of any broken glass along this limestone surface. Sadly people still hurl their beer bottles out the window of their passing cars from time to time...and there may be some beneath the snow when it does snow. Otherwise in any other season there is lovely moss patterns to view, interesting striations and flora to examine up close and personal.\u000a\u000aThis cache is easy to find as most of my geocaches will be. The journey is about finding a number for your log and having a time to geocache in the winter being safe and continuing to have FUN with the game.\u000a\u000aMay all your geocaching clouds have a silver TOPPING!

Unknown if this cache can be approached from Taylor-Kidd Blvd. \u000a\u000aBring your clubs and play a round.

VTake a trip to Ganounkouesnot and travel the width of this magnificent island. Plan a couple of hours to do the caches on this island and enjoy the changing landscape during the seasons as well as take in the views to the wind turbines of this particular area of the island.\u000aWinter conditions  of ice may jeopardize the hide area so please be gentle. If there are problems with retrieval during inclement weather times take a snap of it and email it to me for considerations. On this side of the island it often has the brunt of weather systems and this FOSSIL may not be able to withstand the ice of the Ganounkouesnot's winter winds.\u000aThis is kid friendly but please BYOP as the cache is small and can only hold small GC and TBs.\u000aRespect the area you search in and try to leave it in great order for the next cacher. PLEASE BE GENTLE with the old gnarly dude.\u000aPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE-NO NIGHT CACHING OR AFTER DARK CACHING FOR THIS HIDE. It compromises the area and can be very unsettling to neighbours who know the traffic patterns on this winter-remote area.\u000a\u000a\u000aWOO HOO WHOOT ! OH YEAH BABY! HAPPY FEET!\u000aCONGRATULATION AARONHAYNES AND KIDS. You must fly under the radar to be North of the City and then to the island to get these. Or did you find it in your sleep? LOL LOL

V<font size="3" color="#151B54">Because puzzle caches are probably\u000aone of the most rewarding type of caches, I decided to actually use\u000aone of those ideas that I came up with while trying to solve\u000aanother (doesn't that always happen :) ) and make it a cache of my\u000aown. This cache is a dedication to all puzzles in the past and to\u000acome, and to thank the owners for all the work that goes into\u000acreating the puzzles we all enjoy solving!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe feeling you get when you finally crack the code and solve the\u000apuzzle is great, and even better when you find the cache itself and\u000aare able to take that cache off your radar!<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPuzzle caches add a whole new element to the game of geocaching.\u000aThey allow cachers to use other tools and techniques to \u2018hide\u2019 a\u000acache, and can really test the creativity and persistence of\u000ageocachers. Puzzles allow for cachers who can\u2019t always get out and\u000afind caches as frequently to still be involved in the game, from\u000athe comfort of their own home. The new skills and techniques\u000alearned from solving (and creating) puzzles are endless. Enjoy this\u000apuzzle to the fullest, even through any frustrations, but most of\u000aall, enjoy that feeling when you walk on down to the cache and log\u000athe find, knowing the work you put into it to (although it\u000ashouldn\u2019t be too much :) )<br />\u000a<br />\u000a This cache is hidden on a little somewhat hidden walking trail,\u000a(posted coords are approx one of the trailheads) there are other\u000acaches along the trail, and plenty of room for many more! I specked\u000aout this hide while finding other caches, and finally decided to\u000ause it for this puzzle. The cache will taking a little wiggling to\u000aget out, please be gentle.

VThe cache is a film canister hidden behind the park on MacDougall Drive. Some bush wacking is required to get to this cache. It is not required that you cross the wire fence behind the park. Can be used for trading items, but items must be small. There is also a first to find prize. Have fun and happy caching :) \u000a\u000a\u000a**Congrats to whovencamp on the first to find!**

All caches are MEANT TO BE FOUND and have no need for racing towards FTF. There are no FTF prizes.\u000a\u000aThe geocaches are intended for recreation not competition. \u000a\u000aFUN is the operative word.\u000a\u000aBYOP\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS BRANDON ON YOUR FTF ...another great COMAN 123 FAMILY FUN AND FTF...Woo Hoo!

VThe cache is located at the Cape Vincent ferry dock near the picnic table area of the Customs Office. Today when I placed the cache you could see the last lakers moving up the channel towards Montreal and hear the gaggles of Canada geese announcing the cold weather to come. This cache is placed for the FUN of the trip of the island, a mere 14 kilometers from the Winter Ferry dock at Dawson's Point or a mere 11 kilometers from the summer dock which at this time is being refitted.\u000aThe cache is a small clear plastic gumball container with an orange lid and can only hold a log book. Please bring your own pen to scribe your find and then jigsaw the stump back together again to make sure it remains. \u000aIt will be interesting to see how long this LAMEST cache ever, will stand.Only a KAG will know.

VHere\u2019s a great way to keep in touch with your fellow Geocachers \u2013\u000aThe Geo-Post Office! This type of cache has been around since the\u000aspring of 2006 and the idea is to move postcards between Geo-Post\u000aOffices until they reach their destination. It sounds like a cool,\u000afun way to exchange postcards between you and your Geocaching\u000afriends. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aGeo-Post Office caches are specifically placed with the purpose to\u000ahold postcards. Each postcard is to have a short message and a\u000aforwarding address on it. The address is to include the name of the\u000aGeocacher that you are trying to send the postcard to, their home\u000acity, and a destination cache. Here\u2019s an example: <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<img src="http://www.geocachingonline.com/geoblog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/11_13_07_geopost_office.gif" />\u000a <br />\u000a<br />\u000aWhen you find a Geo-Post Office cache the object is to take a\u000apostcard and move it closer to the city or cache on the address.\u000aIt\u2019s suggested that you then contact the Geocacher who it is being\u000asent to because they might be near enough to go and pick it up.\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000aWe doubt that it will put the national post offices out of business\u000abut it is definitely another cool facet of Geocaching! <br />\u000a<br />\u000aIt\u2019s easy to start \u2013 just write up your postcard, find a Geo-Post\u000aOffice and drop it in \u2018mail box\u2019! Don\u2019t forget to take a postcard\u000ato help it on its way to its destination too! <br />\u000a<br />\u000aHere is a link to the\u000a<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCTTCZ"\u000a   target="_bank">First Geo-Post Office</a> and here is\u000a   <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=2d076c25-a072-4d39-a7f2-0e9e11f3b81a"\u000a   target="_blank">a list of Geo-Post Offices</a>.

There are three smaller\u000acontainers within the larger container, one for the logbook and\u000aSWAG, one for the set of stamps, and the other is for postcards\u000athat want to travel to other cachers. (The cache was placed with\u000afive blank postcards to be filled out by cachers)<br />\u000a<br />\u000aA stamp set is included in this cache for geocachers to add to\u000atheir own collection, if you have a personal stamp please add it to\u000athe logbook.</font><p>Additional Waypoints</p>T11ZMZF - Trailhead 1<br />N 44° 14.166 W 076° 39.715<br />This is the closest trailhead to the cache location, the gate is closed in the non-winter months to prevent ATVs from ruining the trails.<br />T21ZMZF - Trailhead 2<br />N 44° 13.862 W 076° 40.086<br />This trailhead is further from the cache, but the gate is open all year round<br />

MacDonald. It was great and it got me thinking that it was time to put something more back to my friends in this area.10-15 traditional geocaches for the LOVE OF THE OUTDOORS I thought would be a nice way to give back to the geocaching community in celebration of my 2000+ logs and my thanks for many months of some really nice traditionals.\u000a\u000aEnjoy the caches..they are all easy to find and will surely help many who want numbers towards a milestone.\u000a\u000aHappy hunting and happy celebrations in advance to those who are getting close to some great numbers.\u000a\u000aThis would be a great geocache series to introduce newbie, novice or non-geocaching friends to partake. The walk/bike is well worth the time and the unexpected sights along the way will afford enjoyment for all ages.\u000a\u000aPlease try to NOT MOB FTF on these. Try to spread the JOY to a few more people in the geocaching community and perhaps try and call a NEW geocacher to come out and try these.\u000aNO NIGHT RAIDS please as there are neighbouring farms along the way and police are often called because they suspect illegal dumping and other aberrant activity.\u000a\u000aPlease do these in the daylight hours, with my thanks and bring your own writing utensil to log your find.

VI had been introducing a new geocacher to the island many weeks ago and placed this cache enroute to the OWL WOODS with our dear KFN member, JJ. I was waiting for a KAG event to come along to entice some summer geocachers to get a jump on the season...or is that "SPRING"-into-geo-action with the longer days and milder conditions.\u000a\u000aWe had met many birders on our trip this day but most were looking for the BOREAL OWL and not too interested in the common Gallopova. \u000a\u000aThinking that kids would like a walk to a bird that they could spot and find and "touch" well... hence the hide named Meleagris gallopavo was 'hatched'.\u000a\u000aWhile there is a laneway to the cache we would encourage people to park their cars along and off the roadside and WALK IN to the geocache. This is the most unobtrusive way and is much more respectful to the birding habitat and also birders who are hoping to get a "SHOT" at the owls ih this vicinity.\u000a\u000aPlease leave ROVER at home if you come for this geocache, especially in the spring when nesting and many ground birds are active.\u000a\u000aThe cache is NOT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.\u000aalthough the lane does continue to the entry to the PRIVATE members and their guests-ONLY OWL WOODS. \u000a\u000aPlease be gentle with Gallopova and rehide so the strigiformes do not devour him.\u000a\u000a\u000a*** CONGRATULATIONS TO LUNAFLAME FOR THE FTF***

VJust after placing the cache there was a huge hawk circling the area so I do hope that the muggler raptor will not swoop it for its Christmas "Tweet". The cache was well camo'd but to a hungry hawk, camo is just the icing on their meal. Feel free and please do, like the other amiat caches---raise its "bar" and cover it with more cover, especially for the winter months.\u000a\u000aThere is no room for swag in the container and please be reminded to bring your own writing stick.\u000a\u000aThis cache was placed by cache4moore. It is his favourite colour, unfortunately not a great colour for "HIDING" SO PLEASE COVER IT UP COMPLETELY AFTER YOUR VISIT.\u000a\u000aPlease, like any cache container, handle gently and remember, it is owners who make numbers...and owners plan, place and maintain. The geocachers get smileys ..they come and they go, never to have to return...Be conscious of the fact that we enjoy the FUN but not the carelessness of cachers who forget what a cache placement involves...a geocache LIFETIME and many maintenance checks over the course of the initial month of the firsts to find. Thank you for your consideration and may all your caches and numbers be "Tweet".\u000a\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS JACK2U on the Christmas "morning" find. Good to see the raptor left a Tweet surprise for your numbers. WOO HOO HAPPY "TWEET" FEET! WOO HOO!

VAmherst Island is a gem to birders and nothing is more exciting than to take a "ramble" down this lane to sightings of some of the islands famous strigiformes. There have been recent sightings of the Boreal here and the day I was with my KFN friend we met people who had come from Ohio and N.Y. in their hope to enter the owl woods to spy this beauty.\u000a\u000aPlease note that this geocache is NOT IN THE OWL WOODS. The geocache is northwest of the PRIVATE ENTRY to the OWL WOODS. \u000a\u000aEnroute to the cache keep your eyes open for the Snowy Owl who likes to sit atop the tall aerial antennae on the western field...just past the Gallapovo geocache.\u000a\u000aBring your best pair of binoculars and a camera just in case you are able to get glimpses of some of the magnificent visiting birds and the many kinds of strigiformes in this part of the walk.

VA well known spot to most Kingstonians. This place is home to the Kingston SheepDog Trials. Quite the event. Just be carefuol in the rocks and going over the tree limbs. This cache is a peanut butter jar full of trinkets. Please place it back in the same spot as this area is frequented by muggles.\u000a\u000aPlease note the vehicle gate opens at 7 am and closes at dusk but is still quite accessible by foot afterwards or by kayak. No cost to get in. Beautiful year round especially in the fall.\u000a\u000a***Congrats to Glenburnie Hawkeye on  the FTF***\u000a\u000a"Neither rain nor sleet nor hail nor snow will deter the KAG"\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

The Baseline Trail connects to Howe Island Drive on the other side if you wish for a longer walk or are looking for another place to hide a geocache. Weather pending you may want to wear your rubber boots as it can get muddy!  Stay on the trail please as the fields to each side of the trail becomes private property.

VA multi-stage cache in a great set of trails that I used to\u000apractically live in for a summer when I was younger.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aWhen I was younger one of my friends live nearby and nearly the\u000aentire summer we spent roaming these trails, we would bike through\u000athem, exploring, finding new places and just having a great\u000atime.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs this is a great set of trails that have very few geocaches I\u000awanted to introduce everyone to these trails, so everyone can enjoy\u000athem.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThis multi is not for everyone, this cache has been placed for\u000athose that just love the hunt. Love spending time in the woods\u000asearching and hunting, this is not a quick and easy grab, it is not\u000aa number, it is a hunt.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aI am going to give very few details about the cache placement as I\u000awant this to be a challenge, please do not share details of the\u000astages, let all cachers experience this cache for themselves. While\u000aplacing this cache there were many birds chirping, birdseed,\u000abinoculars and a camera may be some things to bring with you for\u000athe hunt.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease do not post spoilers in your log (in the form of text or\u000aphotos).<br />\u000a<br />\u000aFor those that attempt this cache, I hope that you have that great\u000afeeling of success when you complete the task and make the\u000afind!<p>Additional Waypoints</p>

This is what\u000ageocaching is, when you are on the hunt, you've looked in the same\u000aplace 10 times, but you keep looking, you know its not here, but\u000athe GPS says it's near.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aPlease replace everything exactly as found so each cacher has the\u000asame experience, and remember, sometimes you just need a little\u000aencouragement to know that you are near :)

As such it is suggested this cache be done on\u000abicycle.

We&rsquo;ve enjoyed the\u000aquiet pastoral setting of this peaceful island since our daughter\u000afirst outgrew her training wheels. Arguably the most pleasant ride\u000ayou will have anywhere. I will leave it to fellow cachers to refute\u000aor support my opinion in their own words and photos. All caches are\u000aeasily found, camo-taped 3" waterproof match holders hidden within\u000acomfortable reach.</p>\u000a<p>Stella is a small village. Amenities are few but not missed.\u000aRoads are predominantly hard-packed gravel and very ride-able.\u000aTraffic is so scant that the family can safely span the roadway.\u000aTake in the lazy drone of insects, the scent of wildflowers, the\u000atastes of summer, the fresh breeze off the lake, the panoramic\u000avistas. Spend an hour or two rejuvenating the soul. Early morning\u000aor evening is recommended but any time in daylight is great. Take\u000ayour time and enjoy a veritable feast for all the senses.</p>\u000a<center><font color="green">*** Congratulations mTn_biKer65 on the\u000aFTF! ***</font></center>\u000a<br />\u000a<br />

V<p align="center"><span id="ctl00_ContentBody_LongDescription">A\u000aFunny Story A few days ago we made a trip to Howe Island to clean\u000aup the caches over there. Along our journey we came across the St.\u000aPhilomena's Roman Catholic Cemetery, and thought "this would be an\u000aawesome spot for a cache" So we created a little puzzle, hid the\u000afinal and went home to publish the cache. A couple of hours later I\u000areceived a reviewers note stating that My final was too close to\u000aanother cache, that had not been published, and to contact\u000aHypocorism. Hmmmm. could it be that 2 cachers had the same idea for\u000aa great cache location. YEP And the next day "Restin' in St.\u000aPhil's...or not" was born.. So today I make my way back to the\u000aIsland to not only get my cache, but I might as well grab the 2 new\u000aones here as well. I solved the clues to Restin' in St Phil's and\u000aoff I go,. Once I arrive to the final caches location, I walk right\u000aup and make the find, then I walk another 20 feet and grab my cache\u000acontainer WOW. I guess the reviewer was not kidding What are the\u000aodds of that, how could 2 cachers, find a cemetery, create a\u000amystery, find an awesome spot for a final so far away, and have\u000atheir containers 20 feet apart, Guess were cut from the same cloth\u000a(as my mom would say). Now what was I rambling on about, Oh ya You\u000aneed to know how to find my cache, cause it's not at the posted\u000acoordinates. On the way back to the boat my wife finds another\u000asmall cemetery and Yells out (scaring the crap out of me")......\u000a"<em>Why</em>" did my <em>Great Great Great Great</em> Grandfather\u000ahave to die soooo long ago. WHAT ??, Maybe because he was\u000a<em>sooooo old</em> I guess Anyways Good Luck<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font color="#FF0000" size="4">I did not think it would be that\u000ahard.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aHmmmmm Brand new Coman123 Pathtag put in cache for the FTF\u000aprize.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a*************************************************************************<br />\u000a\u000a<br />\u000aSo Bruce the Howe Island Ferry Captain said he's giving me\u000a.75<font color="#FF0000" size="3">&cent; per Cacher.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aWho Hoo&nbsp; $1.50 so far....<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font size="5">Congratulations to Aaronhaynes and Hypocorism on\u000atheir 10 day FTF</font></font></font></span></p><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

It looked like a lot\u000aof fun! In warmer weather, you will probably need to be more\u000acautious of muggles. Feel free to bring a picnic lunch, go for a\u000aswim and otherwise enjoy the beauty of <a rel="nofollow" href=\u000a"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_Lake">Loughborough\u000aLake</a> while waiting them out!</p>\u000a<p>Unforunately, there is a "no pets" sign at the entrance so you\u000ashould probably leave the geo-dogs at home. <img src=\u000a'http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_sad.gif'\u000a     border="0" align="middle"></p>\u000a<p>Parking area is at N 44° 22.177 W 076° 32.270, but you might not\u000awant to park there in the winter.

We thank all of you who have welcomed us and\u000atook the time to get to know us.(thus realizing that we are not\u000areally all that evil!) We will miss Kingston and all the great\u000acachers we have met along the way.</p>\u000a<p>This is part two of a three part series. You need to find parts\u000aone and two to get the co-ordinates for part three. The West\u000aco-ordinates will be found in this cache.</p>\u000a<p>A nice walk into the Parrot Bay Conservation Park. A few meters\u000aof bushwacking is required and the terrian may be a little rocky so\u000atake your time and watch your footing.</p>\u000a<p>The cache is pretty straight forward,BUT you will need to\u000alocate,build,or create a portable 800 THZ ELECTROMAGNETIC\u000aTRANSMITTER to get the waypoints for the third cache.</p>\u000a<b>ANY SPOILER PICTURES OR HINTS WILL BE DELETED!PLEASE DO NOT\u000aLEAVE ANY HINTS IN THE LOGS SO THAT EACH CACHER CAN ENJOY THE FIND!\u000aTHANK YOU!</b><br>\u000a<br>\u000a<p>We got the idea behind this cache from a cache in Ottawa,so we\u000acannot take credit for its originality.</p>\u000a<p><font color="blue">Congratulations to ace862 and mTn biker65 for\u000athe FTF</font></p>

VWhile visiting the "Gnarly Dude" and checking other geocaches in the neighbourhood I came across the most interesting signage. A few meters apart are signs welcoming you to Kingston and welcoming you to Loyalist Township. I was not sure which I would use for the cache title but decided to make it Kingston as that is where I reside. I am also thinking it might be a fun pastime in my drives to see where there are other out-of-the-way signs that I could use for future geohides.So today, this is # 3 in a series of WELCOME TO KINGSTON signs that I have come across on the country drive. \u000a\u000aPlease be careful to NOT PARK on the curve of the road as it is a blind spot for all traffic heading to Kingston or heading to Loyalist Township.You are permitted to park in the turnaround that is only a few meters from the sign and "across" from the cache.\u000a\u000aCONGRATS MRS. COMAN123 for leading the way to FTF for the COMAN123  WOO HOO FTF!

Also, please make sure  you only take one, just incase someone else shows up for the hunt they will also have one to do. Please make sure that the puzzle is placed back as found so that other cachers may experience the same fustration that you may encounter.\u000a\u000aThe final is a ammo container with a well known puzzle twist.\u000a\u000aDepending on how good you are with the puzzle that you will find at stage one this cache may take you 10 min or it may take you all day, who knows.\u000a\u000aI am hoping that this is the first of its kind here in Kingston as I have not come accross this type of puzzle as of yet.\u000a\u000a\u000aFTF Prize of a TAG TB, FTF please contact us to arrange delivery of prize.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Coman 123 "AKA THE BOMBER"\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VI was driving down this sideroad when I thought I had a deja vu moment. It appeared as if the GREASY WALRUS from Wolfe Island had been transported across the lake and landed along this roadside. It is a twin brother to that one and a very cool specimen. If I was an artist I would love to have this as an item for a lawn ornament. It certainly has character.\u000a\u000aIF you look closely you can see that is has become over the years quite intimate with a barb wire fence and please be careful around its trunk for any remnants of the barb that might grab your winter pants or your coat strings.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a very simple grab and the reason it is placed here is because of the interesting structure of that which remains from what once must have been a magnificent, huge tree. Check out the "tumours" and scar lines of this old GNARLY DUDE and perhaps upload your own photos of this old man of the forest.\u000a\u000aPlease be gently with the old thing and try to replace the cache as best you can. Because of the age of this host it is recommended that you be GENTLE with the natural facets of this find.\u000a\u000aPlease bring along your own pen or pencil to sign the log. It is not big enough for any trade items and the FTF is the thrill of meeting this interesting OLD DUDE.\u000a\u000aCongratulations to some of KAG's finest FTFers: the infamous TRIO of the West...\u000amm_dancer, mTn_biKers65 and elsa57 WOO HOO! FTF again!

VTrip to the cache from either trailhead should be 1.125km. Although I say "from either trailhead" when I placed the cache from the southern trailhead on Caton Road I had to ride through approx. 200m of 1.5' deep water that had flooded over the road way. I'll continue to check back on the trail condition and update the cache page when the southern route is open. Until then, unless you like the challenge, I suggest accessing the trail from the northern trailhead on Shane Street.\u000a\u000aCache should be an easy ride/walk for most with almost no turns and only minor elevation changes required.\u000a\u000aThe cache is temporarily a small Lock & Lock container until I can find something larger and more suitable.\u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!!\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to jaktar and Rufus on their shared FTF **\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000aNT1PYT6 - Northern Trailhead (Shane Street)\u000aN 44° 16.283 W 076° 42.934\u000aNorthern Trailhead (Shane Street)\u000aST1PYT6 - Southern Trailhead (Caton Road)\u000aN 44° 15.174 W 076° 42.248\u000aSouthern Trailhead (Caton Road)\u000a

VContainer is a small lock and lock, only room for small trades and a log book.  Should be a quick find.  Drive into the roadside park to safely park your vehicle and if the weather is good enjoy the location.  The namesake for the cache is across the highway.  The plant when it was owned by CIL was known as the Terylene plant, a brand name for polyester fibre.  Numerous ownership changes and corporate focus has resulted in much uncertainty.  PET for soft drink bottles was the lastest product produced here.  Once was one of the area's major employers, things change.  Enjoy the cache and the spot.\u000a\u000aFTF prize -- a Micro Geocoin

She filled up\u000athe ammo can with some children's books, and a few toys, so the\u000akids can bring along a book and trade. Some GPSr's will send you\u000adown Orser road, this is misleading, and your better to come in\u000afrom Murton road, or Railton Rd, if coming from the south.\u000a****Congrats to Bluesaway on her FTF!!****<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK1BNTV - Parking<br />N 44° 21.856 W 076° 37.619<br /><br />

VI was driving out to Bath and noticed how many small parks there were along the highway. I thought that one of those parks might be an ideal spot for a cache, so off I went looking for a hiding spot. The cache is quite close to the road, so you will have to be discreet in your search.\u000athe container itself is a small vitamin bottle so it wont hold many trade items. Please bring a pen with you..I couldnt find one small enough to fit inside the bottle.

VOnce upon a time there were 9 lovely little planets (yes we will pretend Pluto is still a planet), orbiting around the sun.  Then all of a sudden there was a huge explosion that sends all the planets spinning out of orbit!  The team of astronauts have a general idea of the whereabouts of 8 of the planets, but are unable to locate Jupiter, the largest planet!\u000a\u000aThe astronauts need your help to recover Jupiter.  Your mission, do you choose to accept it, is to locate and discover each of the eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto).  Each of these planets contains a vital clue to rediscovering the lost Jupiter.\u000a\u000aYour mission will take you on a back roads tour of the outskirts of Kingston, all of the planets are easy to locate, please be discrete and do not draw attention to yourself, or an evil space alien may capture one of the needed planets.  The planets may be discovered in any order, but you will need all eight to locate Jupiter.\u000a\u000aYour mission begins now, your spaceship awaits outside!\u000a\u000aCongrats to mTn_biKer65, and trusty co-pilot space dog Riley, on successfully completing the entire mission in record time!\u000a\u000aFTF: mTn_biker65\u000a2TF: hypocorism\u000a3TF: bullockj

VThis cache is located at the site where, as a teenager, I (elsa57) worked at a restaurant on Hwy 401 in Odessa, along with many of my friends.  We spent many hours there and it is a little sad to see that this restaurant has been torn down and the parking lot is so overgrown that if you didn't know what was originally at this location, you would never guess.  The restaurant was Bon Voyage when I began working there and later changed to the Chatelaine.\u000a\u000aThere was a little garbage at the cache site and some broken glass, so we cleaned up the mess before we placed the cache.\u000a\u000aThe cache is a large ammo box filled with restaurant related items, 2 books as well as regular trading items.  There is a FTF trophy enclosed.

VChipmunk Ridge is a long trail that runs between the Mud Lake on the south and Wilton Creek on the north.  Near the end are often several large nosey, noisy but friendly dogs.  Make friends with them if they appear, and they will help you look for the cache.  Pretend you are a chipmunk to find this cache.

VWhile travelling to Amherst Island on a maintenance run I thought that I would try and look up a cache I had placed here a year ago and had not been able to publish with the idea in mind for a multi. Today there it was, still secure and within its hiding place so I decided to make it a grab and go and call it after the blackbirds that were eating the grain seed along the road. It is indeed a rare kind of "calling" bird that you will discover when you un-nest it from its hiding place.\u000aEnjoy the island and a number for your visit.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS to AARONHAYNES and RK25 on the FTF

As you move across the board you\u000awill be asked geocaching related trivia questions. These questions\u000ainclude general geocaching knowledge as well as Kingston geocaching\u000aknowledge. (Don't worry if you don't know the answers you don't\u000aneed to answer correctly in order to complete the cartridge.) There\u000ais a Tim Card awaiting the FTF. (Also there is no pen or pencil in\u000athe cache at this time) At the final there is no need to cross any\u000afences.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font size="3" color="blue">The Game:</font> <br />\u000aThe game board is a 6x6 grid, located at Centennial Park baseball\u000adiamond in Odessa. I'm not sure on how often the field is used, but\u000ayou will need to complete the cartridge when the field is empty as\u000ayou will be required to walk on the field. Each turn begins with\u000athe roll of the dice. When you are asked a trivia question, enter\u000athe answer that you think is correct. If you are right you will\u000ajump ahead to a higher space, if you are wrong you will remain on\u000ayour space until your next turn. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<font size="3" color="blue">Multi-Player Option:</font><br />\u000aThis cartridge is perfect to be played with mulitple people. (Each\u000aplayer must have their own Wherigo Player for this style of group\u000aplay.) To play as a group meet at the starting space and choose\u000ayour playing order just like a real board game. Proceed to take\u000aturns rolling the dice (the result of the dice roll is random, so\u000aeach players path through the board will be different.) The first\u000aplayer to reach the end is the winner (although all players will be\u000arequired to reach the end space in order to mark the cartridge as\u000acomplete.) <br />\u000a <br />\u000a<div align="center">\u000a<a href="http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=5e372135-660b-476a-9264-9cc703e89b4e"\u000a   target="_blank"><img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/e9025eac-02cc-465e-99cb-670268273f1b.jpg" />\u000a</a></div><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

If you get a chance bring your fishing rod and and give a try for bass, pike, crappies, perch, sunfish or rock bass. Fishing from the culvert is always a blast for the kids.

VThis lovely little park called Jimmy's Playground seemed to be a nice little area to place a grab and go. I had missed the ferry by five minutes so what better use of my time than to look for a hiding area for a geocache.\u000aThis is a busy spot for ballgames, horseshoe events and outdoor BBQs , in season, so stealth is required at that time. The local establishment alongside the park is also often busy with functions and special events so please use stealth when wandering along the baseball diamond to the cache site.\u000aPlease bring your own pen/pencil and always try to camo the cache so others may have the fun of the find and muggles will be deterred.\u000a\u000aCONGRATULATIONS....WHOO HOO HOOT OH YEAH! to Whovencamp for the find and within MINUTES/SECONDS of the publication. That sure is a humdinger of a "Calling bird" you have. CONGRATS.

VTHE IDEA:\u000aThe level of intensity and degree of obsession among geocachers with the race for \u2018First To Find\u2019 status has caused me no end of amusement. Geocachers are hooked to their internet lifeline awaiting the next flash bulletin announcing the newest hide in their area. Thereupon, all else is immediately dropped and the mad dash is on. Well, this set of caches is my response to this phenomenon. Frustration will almost certainly result from the attempt to seek several far-flung caches simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE RACE:\u000aThere have appeared nine individual FTF Frustration micro caches, numbered 1 to 9, that are hidden near and far. They are to be treated as individual caches, not as a multicache. Those not interested in \u201cthe race\u201d may choose to find any of these caches at a more sedate pace (recommended) and enjoy the scenery along the way. In order to be eligible for the FTF prize though, you must find all nine and submit to all the requirements. Read the descriptions and difficulty ratings carefully. Not all caches are kid-friendly. Frustration is likely, hints are few. Be advised that tree climbing and a head for height may be necessary in some cases. \u000a\u000aTHE POINTS: \u000aThere will be a FTF prize. Qualification for the FTF prize requires the completion of certain conditions. You must find all nine FTF Frustration caches in any order. You must have the highest aggregate point score. Points will be awarded only for the first nine finders of each cache. Scoring will be done according to this chart:\u000aRanking	Points\u000aFTF ..... 9\u000a2nd ..... 8\u000a3rd ..... 7\u000a4th ..... 6\u000a5th ..... 5\u000a6th ..... 4\u000a7th ..... 3\u000a8th ..... 2\u000a9th ..... 1\u000aYou must show proof of your find by uploading a clear photo showing your name in the log sheet, as well as the previous name listed. I will delete any spoilers, photo or written, until the winner is announced. I, and I alone, will decide the final winner, the prize and the time and method of delivering the prize. I will post the aggregate winner on each of the nine FTF Frustration web pages\u000a\u000aTHIS CACHE:\u000aDon\u2019t attempt this one unless you have above-average balance and no fear of heights. Howe Island, a silent gem of the Thousand Islands, located in Lake Ontario, east of Wolfe Island, is often bypassed by tourists. Visit for the quiet drive through the country, there is little else to attract the non-resident, but the locals prefer it that way. General information can be found at http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~theislands/howeisland.html . Ferry schedule and fee information ($4.75 round trip but more often than not you\u2019ll be mistaken for a local and not asked to pay.) can be found at http://www.frontenaccounty.ca/?q=ferry_services . To reach the cache site, stay on Howe Island Drive (aka South Shore Road). This cache was, surprisingly for this locale, already muggled once so please rehide as found.\u000a{My caches #2-9 \u2018FTF Frustration\u2019 series placed at 63 finds}\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on your FTF! **\u000a\u000a                \u000a** ** ** ** ** ** HONOUR ROLL ** ** ** ** ** **\u000a\u000a( All 9 of the FTF Frustration Series completed )\u000a\u000aMay 27 07............bluenoserstoo\u000aNov 14 07..............mTn_biKer65\u000aApr 24 08..................2 paddlers\u000aSep 15 08..................kayakers2\u000aDec 03 08...............KayakGeokid\u000aSep 09 09...............Trail Blaisers\u000aOct 20 09...............AaronHaynes\u000a.

VProbably in the last 3000 years or longer people have frequented this north east side of the lake fishing or camping.This has been a popular swimming hole for the last fifty years that I have been aware of it.In the  sixties carloads of kids would come out from the city and swim even swimming across the lake to a sandbar and back. There used to be a huge pine tree right on the shore with the traditional rope to swing way out into deep water, but the tree  has since decayed and been used for someone's campfire.On a warm summer evening the nearby residents can listen to laughter, the smell of a campfire and maybe country and western music for a couple of hours. This music might give way to heavy metal as the next group of revellers arrives and on rare occasions there have been the sounds of police sirens .This cache is full of swag with a FTF gift certificate of Cineplex Show Tickets. This is my very first cache to hide and I have really got the bug now after attending THE KACHE in Kingston November 1st and meeting so many nice people. Good luck with this find.\u000aThe most convenient entrance  to this narrow road where you can park is right beside the fire number sign 3000. This road runs parallel to the Round Lake Road and the cache is hidden on the narrow strip of land between the roadway and the lake. Please respect the privacy of the two home at either end of this narrow stretch of trail along the water.\u000aEnjoy.....\u000aBEWARE of muggles in the summer months...

VLocated at the site of the Former Grand Trunk Railway Station (now Canadian National Railways) Ernestown, Ontario. Ernestown Station was constructed in 1856 and is one of nine of the approximately 34 first-generation station houses built for the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) that survive in Ontario. For more info on the Former Grand Trunk Railway Station Ernestown, Ontario and other stations in Ontario please visit:\u000ahttp://cnr-in-ontario.com/Reports/Index.html?http://cnr-in-ontario.com/Reports/RSR-089.html\u000a\u000aHope you enjoy the location and the cache. \u000a\u000aThe cache is located on Link Road. If you'd like to venture further although there isn't a No Trespassing sign on the direct access road to the station we're told it is private property. If you venture further through the gate (like we did) you do so at your own risk. Note: If you time it right you can catch a glimpse of the station from the overpass.\u000a\u000aHappy Caching!!!\u000a\u000a** Congratulations to riverrat08 on the FTF **

VWhile driving on the island I noticed this historical plaque placed on a well maintained site of some U.E.L. ancestry.\u000aThe notation on the plaque is worth a visit and the placement is that of a tribute by family members that I thought would interest people.\u000a\u000aThe following information is cited from the pamplet entitled AMHERST ISLAND: JEWEL OF THE LAKE and to which I was encouraged by the owner of the "Locust Lodge" to use for this page.\u000a\u000a"The site is known as the WEMP Burial Cairn of Barnabas and Katherine Wemple, shortened to WEMP. UELS from New York State bought 100 acres on which the Cairn is located. A local legend is that two infant children from a subsequent owner were also buried there. There are apparently spectacular sink holes beyond the CAIRN but please do not visit as they are outside the property permissions.\u000aThe house across the street(green in colour) was called LOCUST LODGE and was bought for Mary Bowes in 1824 by Barnabas Wemp. A log home was first built there and the current farm house was built in 1830's. The barn that is in view from the CAIRN side was part of the original property."\u000a\u000aThe current owner of the LOCUST LODGE is aware of the geocache and was instrumental in providing me with this updated history. I thank her not only for the lessons but for her Amherst hospitality.\u000a\u000aYou will find this another easy grab and go and please be gentle with the limbs of the tree, particularly in the winter or cold.\u000aPlease bring your own pen or pencil for your signatures.\u000a\u000aHope you enjoy the history of this location and another little number for your milestone building.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWOO HOO!

I would also recommend not parking right be side the trail because of the drivers.

VA regular sized camo container. This cache is in the ditch on the side closest to the road and will require a climb. Luckily it shouldn't be too hard as there are a couple of dead trees to help you down and up the slope. I also recommend entering from the trail as it is much easier and safer.

VThis park in Heratige Point is a lovely spot to walk or even take a picnic. You can easily bike or push a stroller for the first part but will need to go off the trail for the last bit. The kids love to play along the waters edge, chasing frogs and watching for ducks, herons and the occasional mink. If the water is high, you may want to be prepared to get your shoes wet. Lots of people walk thier dogs here but you should be able to find it without drawing too much attention. Don't forget to watch for boaters!\u000a\u000aFinally got a FTF prize to BWORM - thanks for being patient - the cahce was up and running long before our prize arrived in the mail...\u000aCongrats to BWORM

VImportant: Although the map shows this cache is accessible by road (Switzer Lane), the road is not open.  You must walk from Alton Road or Portland Avenue.  \u000a\u000aYou will follow the orange isosceles triangles that mark the Rideau Trail to reach this camo'ed lock-n-lock container.  This section of trail is an unopened road allowance and there are two possible approaches.\u000a\u000aFrom the north, parking coordinates on Alton Road are: \u000aN44 25.173\u000aW76 35.850\u000a\u000aFrom the south, parking coordinates on Portland Avenue are: \u000aN44 24.766\u000aW76 35.861\u000a\u000aIf approaching the cache from the south please park on Portland Avenue as there is no parking room at the top of the hill (Switzer Lane) and you will disturb the residents.  Do NOT drive up Switzer Lane even though the map shows this as an open road.  Walking the hill will get your heart rate up!  If the hill looks too daunting you can start from the Alton Road entrance which is a shorter and more level walk.\u000a\u000aThe Rideau Trail runs 387 km from Kingston to Ottawa.  If you want to spend more time on it in this area there are beautiful walks north of Freeman Road and in the Gould Lake Conservation Area which is just a 10 km drive.  The Cataraqui (Trans Canada) Trail also runs through Sydenham (immediately south of and parallel to Portland Avenue) and has plenty of caching opportunities.  Enjoy the local shops and services such as Hillside Coffee Company, Trousdale's General Store and Mill St. Cafe.\u000a\u000aPrize for the FTF is a $5 gift certificate at Hillside Coffee Company in Sydenham.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000aP115YXN - Parking (north approach) - Alton Road\u000aN 44° 25.173 W 076° 35.850\u000aSmall pull-off area on Alton Road at north approach to the cache.\u000aP215YXN - Parking (south approach) - Portland Avenue\u000aN 44° 24.766 W 076° 35.861\u000aStreet parking on Portland Avenue at south approach to the cache.\u000a

VWhen I was a child I would often lie awake in my bed at night and listen to the far away whistle of the CN train as it approached Sydenham.  The trains stopped running in 1986, and the tracks were removed in 1989.  The line has now been turned into the Cataraqui Trail that runs from Strathcona to Smiths Falls.  Come out and enjoy the trail and in this section pop in to Sydenham to see the sights.  Listen carefully, and you may hear the whistle from a bygone era.\u000a\u000aThe cache is under the bridge, so this is not an easy find.  You should use a boat.  Best access is via the trailhead at 44 24.878, 076 35.544.

V"Be tough, yet gentle,\u000ahumble, but bold,\u000a\u000aSwayed always\u000aby beauty and truth"\u000a\u000aIn loving memory of\u000aRobert Jerome Pieh\u000a1916-1993\u000a\u000a\u000aThis poem can be found at a pleasant rest stop on the Trans Canada Trail near the kilometre #75 marker.  We don't know Mr. Pieh or his relations, but one must believe that he is pleased with how his friends and family have honoured him.  Much talent went into building the steps that lead to the simple bench.\u000a\u000aThe walk to this cache is 1.5 km from the trail access on Loughborough-Portland Boundary Road.  It is a very easy walk along the abandoned railway.  You could get here more quickly from Rutledge Road but the slope is tricky and parking isn't great.  You'll also miss the other caches on this portion of the trail.

VWe often bike to this side of the island during the summer and enjoy the view of Nut Island. Not too far down the road to the east in the summer we have enjoyed fantastic swimming along the limestone shelf. \u000aIn the wintertime the ice dunes caused by the wave action of the lake are spectacular and this lakeshore landscape changes dramatically.\u000aPlease be very careful with the old gnarly dude. I had to use a lot of nature's remnants to secure the cache from the elements of the seasons on this southern shore. Not sure how it will deal with vigor!\u000aAs always bring a pen/pencil and it is also handy to have a dry piece of paper in case something happens to the log pages. This area does get some heavy wind and forceful wet weather on inclement days so judge your trip accordingly. That being said, today when I placed the cache, it was spectacular.\u000a\u000aEnjoy.

VThere are so many great caches along the abandoned railway right-of-ways in and around Kingston and Frontenac.  This cache is hidden on a short section of trail where the Cataraqui Trail runs parallel to the Kingston & Pembroke line.\u000a\u000aThe Cataraqui Trail (which, here, is the former Kingston, Napanee and Western Railway) links Harrowsmith and Sydenham and is a well developed foot/cycling/snowmobiling path.  The K&P in this section is now owned by the County of Frontenac, but is still an undeveloped path.  The County is working towards it being an excellent link to the City of Kingston\u2019s K&P Trail and an ideal continuation of the Trans-Canada Trail.\u000a\u000aThe cache is located next to the visible but undeveloped K&P right-of-way and if you carry on further east you will see how the two former railroads bend away from one another.  The KN&W heading northeast and the K&P heading south.

VWhile visiting some folks on Dog Lake I could hear the laughter of children skating on the ice and four wheeling along the frozen lake. The sounds of their voices was likened to a Christmas CAROL, their happiness a reflection to me of the true season of Christmas...family, good friends and fellowship. So in keeping with the season, I placed a Christmas jewel along the roadway, slightly off the roadside in a nice little cleft of rock away from the winds of winter  and perhaps the howling of Old Man Winter and just maybe free from the fingers of Jack Frost.\u000aThe container is wrapped in an outer protective ziplock so please insure that it is not torn in your haste for the race of a FTF or the haste to get back for the Christmas turkey.\u000aAs this is alongside a country side road, be advised to park safely, use stealth at all times and try to not leave any geotrails for muggles to investigate.\u000aDuring the winter the snowbanks may increase but the hide should be winter friendly. There is no room in the cache for trackables or swag so please bring your own pen and replace the cache delicately and in positive, enduring fashion so others may enjoy the same experience and the smiley that you will.\u000aMerry Christmas to all and may you be singing a happy song when you drive homeward with your smiley.\u000a\u000aWOO HOO WHOOT YIPPEE HAPPY DANCE HAPPY FEET\u000a\u000aCongratulations to Aaronhaynes and Coman123 on the FTF. Also a note of congratulations on the milestone Aaron. Now go home and thank your wives for being terrific geocaching supports for your night time rides. WOO HOO WHOOT HAPPY DANCE!! JINGLE JINGLE.

VThe Series (well, it's not a series yet - just one cache, but give us time!):\u000aEach of these multi-caches is inspired by the unfortunate passengers of our vehicles who have had enough of the twists, turns and hills of the Land O\u2019Lakes\u2019 wonderful back roads.\u000a\u000aMost of our experiences are with friends and family, without bias to age, from Southwestern Ontario who, unfortunately for them, don\u2019t have the Canadian Shield at their doorstep.  Highway 400 might be the physiological dividing line of a unique gene that only Eastern Ontarians have that helps to block the stomach churning reflex responsible for lost lunches and messy back seats.  \u000a\u000aDue to their make-up, these roads aren\u2019t always the safest to pull-over from.  We have endevoured to make this series as enjoyable as possible by putting waypoint locations near convenient places to park or wider than normal shoulders.  We also tried to pick out some of the most scenic locations because the Land O\u2019Lakes is full of beauty.  \u000a\u000aMost of the roads are hard surfaced which makes them absolute fun for motorcycling.  \u000a\u000aIf you want to add to the series, we'd be delighted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis cache:\u000aDespite heavy reconstruction of Bedford Road during the summer of 2008, which shaved some of the hills and lessened the sharpness of some of the hairpins, this remains a twisty, turny delight.  There are 24 km of fun, but we've carved out only the first southern most chunk for this multi.\u000a\u000aApproaching from the south, this road wastes no time in getting your heart racing and stomach gurgling.  The contrast in landscapes is immediately and dramatically evident as one ends the drive past abandoned farmsteads on the gentle Limestone Plain and enters the forest and granite of the Canadian Shield.  \u000a\u000aThis is also a favourite route for the Kingston Velo Club because of its light traffic and short but steep lactic acid agitating hills.  Be cautious of cyclists.\u000a\u000aThe multi has 2 micro waypoints and a small container for a final.  It covers about 4.5 km of driving and takes you for very short walks into the east side of Gould Lake Conservation Area.  If you have more time enjoy this great trail system.\u000a\u000aAdditional Waypoints\u000a

VAmherst island has a host of humungus balsam poplars, cottonwoods and oak trees that I  absolutely love to use for geocache "hidee holes".\u000aThis tree actually came about by default as the tree more north of this one proved NOT a good idea. It was a BEE tree, magnificent in its hive and was complete with layers and layers of combs. Some of you who are not allergic to bees might like to find it as a bonus for a photo but NOT for a hide area.\u000aAs with any cavity on any tree, please be careful of your first delve...who knows what may lurk within the depth of such old giants...especially over time when a cache is first placed. At the time of the placement of this cache there was only one FRIENDLY critter in the deep home of the dude.\u000aThe cache container requires a gentle retrieval and a lot of camo to protect it from the elements when you re-hide it. This is a very kid friendly hide and you may trade up or trade even for the toy inside. Dino would like a dino theme.\u000aBring your own pen/pencil for the log...and once again, enjoy this fabulous island.

VOn my way home from Kingston the thought occured to me that this little carpool was just crying for a cache, so I put one here.  Is a little place just south of the 401.  Nice suroundings by GZ.\u000aAvoid the East side of the parking area, that is the area referenced in the logs.\u000aCache is now North of the parking area.\u000aPlease make sure you put the cache back exactly as it was .\u000aAbove all have some fun.\u000a\u000aPencil added Oct 29 2007\u000aCache moved May 23, 2008 distance approx. 154ft. to a more suitable spot.

VThe "Restin'" caches are a series that will take you to local cemeteries, places of historical interest. From pioneers and modern people these places are full of interesting information.  Please take your time - walk around, visit with the past.  The caches are easy to find, and please respect where you are.\u000a\u000aThis is the oldest "Restin'"  Cache I have placed.  On this site was the Fourth Line United Church.  Built in 1792 and used until 1967.  "For 175 years the Fourth line had the proud distinction of being the oldest former Methodist Congregation in Upper Canada.  Holding regular Sunday services in loving memory of all those faithful and devoted souls who worshipped and served god and now have entered into their reward. Their name liveth for evermore."  \u000a\u000aEnjoy the chestnuts when they are ready.

The walk is fairly level if you keep to the shore, quite steep, if you choose the direct route to the cache. \u000a\u000aIn the winter, the walk will be longer and tougher, as the road is not maintained.\u000a\u000aThe container is unique, but not camo'ed.\u000a\u000aThere is a roadside pullout at the bottom of the valley (big bend).

VA beautiful roadside park on the Loyalist Parkway west of Bath.\u000aThere are 3 historic plaques in the park but the one about the\u000atavern is the most interesting. Henry Finkle built the first tavern\u000abetween Kingston &amp; York here in 1786, he also built a brewery\u000aand a school. None of this remains all reduced to a memorial\u000aplaque. If you are at the event cache in Kingston on Oct.\u000a2/07(Tuesday Night Lights) hoist a jar to Henry I'm sure he will\u000aappreciate it.

A lot of those\u000amovies seemed to have a place called "Red Rock Canyon" hence the\u000acache name although this is hardly a canyon. Cache is a small lock\u000aand lock container, cammoed.

VWelcome to the Frontenac Axis!  This is a narrow extension of the Canadian Shield which traverses the area and links the Algonquin Highlands with the Adirondack Mountains.  At the posted coordinates you are straddling the join between the St. Lawrence Lowlands and the Shield.  \u000a\u000aSt. Lawrence Lowlands\u000aThe sedimentary rocks that lie under the surface of the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands were formed some 500 million years ago, in the early Paleozoic Era. At that time, a shallow sea existed along the southern edge of the Canadian Shield. Over time the water and the sediments at the bottom of the sea pushed down on sediments beneath them. This pressure gradually turned the lower sediments into sedimentary rocks such as limestone.\u000a\u000aCanadian Shield \u000aThe Canadian Shield, also known as the Precambrian Shield or Laurentian Plateau, covers about half of Canada as well as most of Greenland and part of the northern United States; an area of 4.4 million square kilometers (1.7 million square miles).\u000aIt is the oldest part of the North American crustal plate and contains fossils of bacteria and algae over 2 billion years old.\u000aThe shield is composed of granite and the earth's greatest area of exposed Precambrian rock (igneous and metamorphic rock formed in the Precambrian geological era 500 million years ago). \u000aThe shield was the first part of the continent to be permanently raised above sea-level.  Subsequent rising and falling, folding, erosion and continental ice sheets have created its present topography.  The reoccurring invasion and withdrawal of the ice sheets (1.6 million to 10,000 years ago) depressed the surface creating Hudson Bay, scraped out tens of thousands of lake basins, carried away much of the soil cover and redeposited glacial debris. \u000aThe shield plateau ranges from 305 to 610 meters (1000 to 2000 feet) above sea level.  In northern Labrador and Baffin Island the crustal plate has tilted so much that it rises over 1,500 meters (5,000 feet) above sea level. There are a number of mountain ranges within the shield: the Adirondack (northeastern New York state), Superior Highlands (northern Minnesota, Wisconsin & Michigan states), Torngat and Laurentian.\u000aThe shield is a rich source of metallic minerals such as iron, nickel, copper, zinc, uranium, gold, silver, platinum and molybdenum.\u000a\u000aYour tasks at the cache location are straight forward, but may require you to do a little research after the drive:\u000aIf you look North from the coordinates you will see an exposed outcrop of the Shield, two Pre-Cambrian rock types are visible, what are they?\u000aLooking South is the exposed St. Lawrence Lowlands, what is the rock type here?\u000aEmail me the answers.\u000aBoth answers can be derived by visually checking as you drive-by.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTime warp from billion year old rock to 570 million year old in a couple of metres.

VAnother of many on the Cataraqui Trail. None in this section. 2\u000aaccess points 1.4km apart hence the cache name. Nice level rail\u000abed, cache is just a few metres off the trail. Container is a\u000amedium size lock &amp; lock type. Should be quick. Find at night?\u000aSure. The container is a re-use of one from a cache I had to\u000aarchive not far from here (Dam View) I left all the contents that\u000awere in it when retrieved except of course the log book.

VOn November 3, 2006, Bluelamb03 turns 50 years old.  In honour of this milestone, Scarlett03, Remote Sensor and GreyElf have conspired to place 5 new caches-one for each decade of Bluelamb03\u2019s life.  The caches represent different significant events in Bluelamb03\u2019s life.

VBluelamb03\u2019s friendship with Remote Sensor meant stays at the family cottage.  The love of camping and difficult conditions had been instilled in Bluelamb03 by the Canadian Armed Forces.  He leapt at the opportunity to open up and close down the cottage each season.  With Remote Sensor and other buddies, he annually spent the early spring and late fall in the unheated, un-insulated, electricity-free cottage.  He and the guys bonded over hard work, cold mornings, silly pranks and tons of junk food (and drink.)  These heady days ended when girlfriends, wives and mini-vans entered the picture.\u000a\u000aThe cache has been placed in the wilderness, just like the cottage.\u000a\u000aIt is an island cache so you will need ice or a boat.

VT stands for Taryn.  K stands for Katie.  BFF stands for Best Friends Forever.  \u000a\u000aThe girls wanted to hide a cache dedicated to their friendship and to other BFFs.  The cache is a large peanut butter container hidden along a nice country road which is often travelled when they go to each other's homes.  There is plenty of room for safe parking.  No need to cross the fence.\u000a\u000aThe girls' request is to post a picture of you with your BFF or caching buddy.  Also, all of the things they put in the cache are two of a kind - two rulers, two watches, etc.  See if you can keep this tradition alive.

This is a busy service centre that has a neat picnic area in behind the centre where you can walk and stretch your legs or have a picnic... or find a cache...This cache is a short walk from the parking area...cache is small and contains a micro log book (won't fit any home style geo-labels), pencil is provided and there is a FTF certificate inside.  This is a "muggle" zone in the summer so be weary of what lurks and place the cache exactly back as you found it or a muggle may accidently come across it and/or destroy it.  The cache should be an easy find for everyone.  This is a cache that is replacing the same name that was archived summer 2006.\u000a401 series service centres #4 West Kingston

VA short stroll along the Cataraqui Trail just inside Lennox & Addington County.  Less than 300 metres from the trailhead on Camden-Portland Boundary Road.  Trail is groomed in the winter for snowmachines so watch out for them (although you'll hear them from a mile away).\u000a\u000aA good cache for the kids - even the smallest of walkers should be okay. \u000a\u000aName really doesn't mean anything - just a word that we were having fun with during our walk.

VAfter you find the cache go to 44 27.333, 076 33.331, right in front of you will be a log in the water.  During the summer season, the local turtles love to sun themselves on this log.  If the turtles are there (passing boats tend to clear the log) please take a picture and post it.  Include the turtle count in your log.  Remember be environmentally sensitive; just take pictures do not disturb the turtles or the log.  If you do not know where the holes are, the road can be interesting.

VCache is located on a section of the Ridge Runners Snowmobile Club\u000atrail North West of Kingston near the Camden Braes Golf Course. The\u000atrail is wide and reasonably well maintained although there are\u000asome low spots where water can collect. Cache is a small ammo box\u000ahidden just metres off the trail. Happy Caching!!! Note: Since the\u000atrail is maintained by a snowmobile club to prevent damage please\u000arefrain from driving any motorized vehicles on the\u000atrails.<p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VTHE IDEA:\u000aThe level of intensity and degree of obsession among geocachers with the race for \u2018First To Find\u2019 status has caused me no end of amusement. Geocachers are hooked to their internet lifeline awaiting the next flash bulletin announcing the newest hide in their area. Thereupon, all else is immediately dropped and the mad dash is on. Well, this set of caches is my response to this phenomenon. Frustration will almost certainly result from the attempt to seek several far-flung caches simultaneously.\u000a\u000aTHE RACE:\u000aThere have appeared nine individual FTF Frustration micro caches, numbered 1 to 9, that are hidden near and far. They are to be treated as individual caches, not as a multicache. Those not interested in \u201cthe race\u201d may choose to find any of these caches at a more sedate pace (recommended) and enjoy the scenery along the way. In order to be eligible for the FTF prize though, you must find all nine and submit to all the requirements. Read the descriptions and difficulty ratings carefully. Not all caches are kid-friendly. Frustration is likely, hints are few. Be advised that tree climbing and a head for height may be necessary in some cases. \u000a\u000aTHE POINTS: \u000aThere will be a FTF prize. Qualification for the FTF prize requires the completion of certain conditions. You must find all nine FTF Frustration caches in any order. You must have the highest aggregate point score. Points will be awarded only for the first nine finders of each cache. Scoring will be done according to this chart:\u000aRanking	Points\u000aFTF ..... 9\u000a2nd ..... 8\u000a3rd ..... 7\u000a4th ..... 6\u000a5th ..... 5\u000a6th ..... 4\u000a7th ..... 3\u000a8th ..... 2\u000a9th ..... 1\u000aYou must show proof of your find by uploading a clear photo showing your name in the log sheet, as well as the previous name listed. I will delete any spoilers, photo or written, until the winner is announced. I, and I alone, will decide the final winner, the prize and the time and method of delivering the prize. I will post the aggregate winner on each of the nine FTF Frustration web pages.\u000a\u000aTHIS CACHE:\u000aEvery time I step onto Amherst Island I can feel any stress and worry drain away. This is one of those places where you want to spend a considerable part of the day walking, thinking, and generally taking in the peace and tranquility. A car may be necessary to tour the whole island. An even better way to get around is by bicycle. Information about Amherst Island, including ferry schedule and fees can be found at http://www.amherstisland.on.ca/index.htm . Keep track of ferry departure times or you\u2019ll wait an extra hour. To reach the cache, find your way to Back Beach. Roll down the windows and experience the area with all your senses. On the return trip try a different route back.\u000a\u000a*Congratulations to BLUENOSERSTOO on your FTF!*\u000a\u000a                \u000a** ** ** **   HONOUR ROLL  ** ** ** **\u000a\u000a( All 9 of the FTF Frustration Series completed )\u000a\u000aMay 27 07............bluenoserstoo\u000aNov 14 07..............mTn_biKer65\u000aApr 24 08.................2 paddlers\u000aSep 15 08..................kayakers2\u000aDec 03 08...............KayakGeokid\u000aSep 09 09...............Trail Blaisers\u000aOct 20 09...............AaronHaynes\u000a.

I think that I am seeing puzzle\u000acaches everywhere these days, I wonder why? I took a picture of it,\u000aand using my new skills (thanks KAG website and Swimmrguy), I am\u000asharing it with you all. <br />\u000a<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/59e5e575-6145-456d-9b0a-4bc0a9e23b54.jpg" />\u000a <br /><p>Additional Waypoints</p>

VAlthough I have driven on many area backroads over the years I never noticed the amazing view from this bridge on the road until a couple of years ago. There needed to be a cache there so others would stop and enjoy it! Now there is.  \u000a\u000aCache is a camoflauged pill bottle containing a logbook and a new set of never-used dogtags for the FTF. There is also a small geocoin to move along. There is no room for trade items, and although there's a little pencil in the cache you may wish to bring your own writing implement.\u000a\u000aThe cache should be an easy find. There is a great place to park - DON'T park on the bridge. There is plenty of CITO potential in the area, too!

VCollect the clue for the final!\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a day-time only cache.\u000a\u000aI have not reccomended this one for kids, as it is a roadside, and a very busy one at that. \u000a\u000aI think it takes a lot of nerve to work with these creatures. You will not see the hives around here. They are all at other locations. Bees play a vital role in pollinating crops, and the bee-keeper needs his bees to visit crops to produce honey. Therefore, although some hives have permanent locations, some hives move to be in close proximity to crops in bloom. These tend to be the fruit crops. In late summer the farmer starts to harvest his crop, but always leaves enough to feed the colony through the winter. Sometimes, when there is a harsh winter, the bees must be given a supplement. In late fall the hives are wrapped to provide extra protection for the bees. The bees can still exit and enter the hive. The honey is brought here to be pasturized and packaged.

VHappened to spot this lovely hillside cemetery on the way to a cache on Emerald Road and decided to stop by the neighbours and inquire about the old resting spot. I was told that it was owned by the Catholic Church and is still used by the islanders. \u000aYou will notice three black wooden crosses on the cemetery gate and a chain that opens the gate for your entry. I parked on the roadway and walked the short distance to the cache.\u000aThere are some really old markers here and a lot of interesting names that will most likely be recognized by some KAG members.\u000aPlease respect the resting spot of this cemetery and do not cache this after dark or during times of visitation by islanders.\u000aBYOP and a camera if you wish to snap some of the old stones and the view of the lakeside, too.\u000a\u000a\u000aZ-O-O-O-M-ing in with the FTF is COMAN123. WOO HOO! HOOT! YEE-HAW! HAPPY FEET! C-E-L-E-B-R-A-T-E! Last time I looked I think I saw Aaron at West Marine checking out Zodiaks!   Hee Hee Hee
